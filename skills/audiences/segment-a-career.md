## What They're Screening Against

### Red Flags for This Audience:
❌ Pure sales background with no product exposure
❌ Talking only about quota attainment and deals closed
❌ No evidence of technical capability
❌ Can't articulate product thinking
❌ Jargon-heavy without substance
❌ Generic LinkedIn corporate speak

### Green Flags They're Looking For:

## Language to Use

### Product Terminology (Use Frequently):
✅ adoption | activation | user problems | workflow design | integration points | system design | bottleneck | cross-functional | internal tools | handoff points | time-to-value | product-led | user journey

### GTM + Ops Terminology (Use to Show Bridge):
✅ revenue operations | GTM alignment | sales enablement | deal velocity | conversion optimization | pipeline health | lead scoring

### Technical Terminology (Use to Build Credibility):
✅ API integration | webhook | automation | workflow orchestration | no-code/low-code | AI implementation | data pipeline | CRM architecture

### Avoid (Sales-Only Language):
❌ closing deals | quota attainment | pipeline management | hitting numbers | prospecting | cold calling | deal hunting

---

## Framing Strategy

### How to Frame Your Experience:

**Instead of:**
"I closed $2M in deals last quarter."

**Say:**
"I built a lead scoring system that reduced time-to-first-value by 34%, which contributed to a 19% lift in close rate."

---

**Instead of:**
"I managed a sales pipeline of 100+ accounts."

**Say:**
"I designed a workflow that connected CRM, product data, and quote generation—cutting manual handoffs between sales and ops by 60%."

---

**Instead of:**
"I'm great at building relationships with customers."

**Say:**
"I mapped the entire customer journey from demo to activation, identified 3 critical drop-off points, and built automated workflows to bridge them."

---

## Content Themes That Resonate

### 1. "What I Built" Content
**Why It Works:** Demonstrates technical capability and product thinking.

**Topics:**
- Internal tools you've created
- Workflows that bridge sales and product
- Automation that improved cross-functional handoffs
- Data systems that improved decision-making

**Example Hook:**
```
Built a workflow this week that cut quote turnaround from 2 days to 20 minutes.

Here's how product and sales became one system.
```

---

### 2. "Cross-Functional Problem Solving"
**Why It Works:** Shows you can operate between teams.

**Topics:**
- How you connected sales insights to product roadmap
- Workflows that improved sales + product alignment
- Tools that bridged GTM and product data
- How you translated customer feedback into product requirements

**Example Hook:**
```
Most sales teams measure revenue. I started measuring activation.

Here's why that changed everything.
```

---

### 3. "Modern Skills Applied to Business Problems"
**Why It Works:** Shows you're technically current and self-directed.

**Topics:**
- AI for sales operations
- Automation for internal processes
- Data analysis for GTM strategy
- Integration projects

**Example Hook:**
```
Everyone's talking about AI for customer-facing use cases.

The real leverage? Internal operations nobody sees.
```

---

### 4. "Reframing Sales as Product"
**Why It Works:** Repositions sales experience in product language.

**Topics:**
- Territory planning as market segmentation
- Deal qualification as user research
- Customer conversations as product discovery
- Sales process as user journey

**Example Hook:**
```
I used to think sales was about closing deals.

Then I started treating it like product design.
```

---

## Proof Points to Emphasize

### Credibility Signals:
- **Technical builds:** GitHub repos, n8n workflows, automation screenshots
- **Cross-functional projects:** Examples of sales + product + ops collaboration
- **Modern tools:** Claude API, n8n, Make, Cursor, Python scripts
- **Education:** MBA, MSBA (mention sparingly, not as primary credential)
- **Quantified outcomes:** Specific metrics (time saved, efficiency gained, adoption improved)

### Format for Proof:
```
Not: "I have experience with AI tools."
But: "Built 20+ AI-powered workflows using Claude API, n8n, and Python."

Not: "I understand product operations."
But: "Designed a lead scoring system that integrated CRM, product usage data, and deal stage to predict activation likelihood."

Not: "I'm passionate about automation."
But: "Automated 15 internal processes, saving 25 hours/week across the sales team."
```

## Content Structure for This Audience

### Opening Hook Pattern:
Lead with **product thinking** or **system insight**, not sales results.

✅ "Most companies treat sales and product as separate funnels. Here's why that breaks."
✅ "Built a tool this week that connects GTM to product activation. Here's what I learned."
✅ "The bottleneck isn't your sales process. It's the handoff to product."

❌ "Closed 20 deals this month using this framework."
❌ "Here's how I hit 150% of quota."

---

### Middle Section Pattern:
Focus on **how you built it** and **what systems you connected**, not just what you achieved.

Include:
- What you built (technical detail)
- Why you built it (user/business problem)
- How it integrated (cross-functional aspect)
- What you learned (insight)

---

### Closing Pattern:
Invite **product/ops discussion**, not sales tactics discussion.

✅ "How are you connecting GTM and product at your company?"
✅ "What's the biggest gap between your sales and product teams?"
✅ "Anyone else building internal tools to bridge this?"

❌ "What's your closing strategy?"
❌ "How do you hit quota?"

---

## Example Post (Full)

```
Most sales teams measure revenue. I started measuring activation.

When I built our internal lead scoring system, I realized the real
bottleneck wasn't deal volume—it was how long it took prospects to
experience value.

So I designed a workflow that bridged sales handoff and product
onboarding. It automatically triggered onboarding sequences based
on deal stage.

The build:
→ CRM webhook triggered on "Deal Closed"
→ n8n workflow pulled customer data + use case
→ Routed to appropriate onboarding sequence in product
→ Sales got real-time activation alerts

Result: 34% faster time-to-first-value, which turned into a 19%
lift in close rate.

Key insight: Sales and product aren't separate funnels. They're
one system. The handoff is where most deals die.

How are you connecting GTM and product at your company?

## Visual Content Strategy

### What to Share:
- Workflow diagrams (n8n screenshots)
- Architecture diagrams (how systems connect)
- Before/after process flows
- Data dashboards (product + GTM metrics combined)
- GitHub repositories (public portfolio)

### What to Avoid:
- Sales dashboards with quota numbers
- Generic motivational graphics
- Stock photos
- Anything that screams "salesperson trying to look technical"

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Comments to Reply To:
Prioritize engagement from:
- Product managers
- RevOps / Sales Ops leaders
- Technical recruiters
- Startup founders (potential hiring managers)
- People asking about your builds

### How to Reply:
- Offer to share technical details
- Ask about their setup (learn + build connection)
- Invite to DM for deeper discussion (on technical topics only)
- Share relevant resources (GitHub, Substack, other posts)

---

## Long-Term Positioning

### What You're Building Toward:
**Perceived Identity:** "Technical operator who bridges product and GTM"

**Not:** "Salesperson learning to code"
**Not:** "Product person with sales experience"
**But:** "Hybrid operator who builds systems connecting revenue and product"

### Evidence to Accumulate:
- 20+ posts demonstrating technical builds
- Public portfolio of automation projects
- Substack essays on product-GTM alignment
- GitHub repos showing actual code
- Engagement from product/ops leaders

---

## Success Metrics

### Indicators You're Resonating with This Audience:

✅ **Inbound recruiter messages for Product/Marketing roles** (not sales roles)
✅ **Profile views from VP Product, Head of Ops, etc.**
✅ **Comments/questions from product managers asking about your builds**
✅ **Shares from RevOps/Product Ops community**
✅ **DMs asking for technical details on your workflows**

❌ Generic sales recruiter spam
❌ "Great post!" comments with no substance
❌ Engagement only from other salespeople

---

## Red Lines (Employment Safety)

Even when targeting this audience, you must still:

❌ NEVER position as building an agency
❌ NEVER offer services or consulting
❌ NEVER mention client work

✅ Frame everything as:
- Internal projects at current company
- Personal skill-building
- Experiments and learning
- Portfolio development for career transition
