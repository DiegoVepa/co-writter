---

## What They're Screening Against

### Red Flags for This Audience:
❌ Corporate jargon and buzzwords
❌ Vague promises without numbers
❌ "Digital transformation" speak
❌ Overly complex technical explanations
❌ Salesy or consultant-like tone
❌ No proof or examples
❌ Hidden costs or ongoing complexity

### Green Flags They're Looking For:

✅ Specific time/money savings
✅ Examples from similar businesses
✅ Simple, practical solutions
✅ Honest about costs and effort
✅ "I've done this before" credibility

---

## Language to Use

### Plain Business Language (Use Frequently):
✅ time savings | headache | bottleneck | manual work | follow-ups | scheduling | no-shows | customer complaints | wasted time | phone tag | missed calls | invoice reminders | quote follow-ups

### Problem Language They Recognize:
✅ "people not showing up" | "chasing payments" | "double-booked appointments" | "lost in the truck" | "written on a napkin" | "spreadsheet nightmare" | "forgetting to follow up"

### ROI Language (Always Quantify):
✅ "$X saved per month" | "Y hours/week back" | "Z% fewer no-shows" | "pays for itself in X weeks" | "15 minutes to set up" | "costs $X/month to run"

### Avoid (Corporate/Tech Jargon):
❌ digital transformation | AI-powered | cutting-edge | synergy | leverage | scalable solution | optimize | disrupt | innovation | seamless integration | cloud-based platform

### Avoid (Consultant Speak):
❌ strategic initiative | implementation roadmap | stakeholder alignment | change management | best practices | thought leadership

---

## Framing Strategy

### How to Frame Your Work:

**Instead of:**
"I provide AI automation consulting for small businesses."

**Say:**
"I've been helping a friend who runs an HVAC company. He was losing $2K/month to no-shows. Built him a simple reminder system that cut no-shows by 60%."

---

**Instead of:**
"My agency specializes in workflow optimization."

**Say:**
"Built a tool for my cousin's plumbing business that saves him 4 hours/week on scheduling and follow-ups. Took 45 minutes to set up, costs $0/month."

---

**Instead of:**
"Leveraging cutting-edge AI to transform your customer experience."

**Say:**
"Automated the annoying parts: reminder texts, invoice follow-ups, and review requests. Your customers get replies faster, you save time."

---

## Employment Safety Framing (CRITICAL)

**You MUST frame all agency-related content as personal projects, NOT paid client work.**

### Safe Framing:
✅ "Helping a friend..."
✅ "Built this for my cousin's business..."
✅ "Personal project for a family member..."
✅ "Experimenting with automation for..."
✅ "Testing an idea with a local business..."

### Unsafe Framing (NEVER USE):
❌ "My client..."
❌ "Recent agency project..."
❌ "Engagement with a customer..."
❌ "If you need similar services..."
❌ "DM me for help..."
❌ "Available for hire..."

---

## Content Structure for This Audience

### Opening Hook Pattern:
Lead with **the problem** or **the savings**, not the technology.

✅ "My friend runs a plumbing company. He was losing $2K/month to no-shows."
✅ "Set this up in 45 minutes. Saved 5 hours/week."
✅ "The best AI opportunities are in businesses nobody talks about."

❌ "Leveraging AI to optimize service operations."
❌ "Implementing a digital transformation strategy for SMBs."

---

### Middle Section Pattern:
Focus on **what it does** (in plain language) and **what it costs** (transparent).

Include:
- The specific problem (relatable language)
- What the solution does (simple explanation)
- How long it took to build
- What it costs (setup + ongoing)
- Real results (specific numbers)

Avoid:
- Technical jargon
- Feature lists without outcomes
- Vague promises
- Hidden complexity

---

### Closing Pattern:
Invite **their** problem or question, not a sales pitch.

✅ "What's one boring process in your business you'd automate first?"
✅ "Anyone else dealing with no-shows?"
✅ "What's the most annoying manual task you do weekly?"

❌ "DM me if you want help with this."
❌ "Book a call to discuss your automation needs."

---

## Example Post (Full)

```
My friend runs a plumbing company. He was losing $2K/month to no-shows.

People would book appointments, then just not answer the door.
No call, no reschedule.

I built him a simple reminder system:
→ Automated text 24 hours before appointment
→ Second text 2 hours before
→ If they don't confirm the 2-hour text, system flags it

Tools used:
- Calendly (he was already using it)
- Twilio (automated texts, $0.0079 per message)
- n8n (free tier, connects everything)

Setup cost: $0
Time to build: 45 minutes
Monthly cost: ~$15 (text messages)

Results after 30 days:
- No-shows dropped from 30% to 12%
- Revenue recovered: ~$2,400/month
- Time saved: 6 hours/week (no wasted drives)

ROI: 160x in the first month.

Sometimes the best automation is just asking twice.

What's one process in your business you'd automate first?

## Visual Content Strategy

### What to Share:
- Simple before/after diagrams
- Screenshots of workflows (annotated in plain language)
- ROI charts (cost vs. savings)
- Photos of you working with business owners (if safe)
- Text message examples (automation in action)

### What to Avoid:
- Complex technical diagrams
- Corporate stock photos
- Overly designed graphics
- Anything that looks like a sales deck

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Comments to Reply To:
Prioritize engagement from:
- Service business owners
- People in HVAC, plumbing, trades
- Questions about specific problems
- Requests for tool recommendations

### How to Reply:
- Offer specific advice (not "DM me")
- Share similar examples
- Ask about their specific setup
- Point to helpful resources (but not sales pitches)

**Example Reply:**
```
Comment: "We have the same no-show problem. What tool did you use?"

Your Reply: "Used Calendly + Twilio + n8n. Calendly has a free tier,
Twilio costs pennies per text, and n8n is free for this use case.
Took about 45 min to set up. Happy to point you to a tutorial if helpful."
```

## Long-Term Positioning

### What You're Building Toward:
**Perceived Identity:** "The guy who helps boring businesses automate boring problems"

## Red Lines (Employment Safety)

**CRITICAL: This audience makes it tempting to offer services. DON'T.**

❌ NEVER:
- Offer paid consulting
- Position as agency work
- Say "DM me for services"
- Use client/customer language
- Mention pricing for your work

✅ ALWAYS:
- Frame as helping friends/family
- Personal projects and experiments
- "Testing ideas" language
- Share learnings, not offerings

**Example Safe Post:**
```
✅ "I've been helping a friend automate his HVAC business..."

❌ "I help HVAC companies automate operations. DM me for pricing."
```

---

## Conversion Strategy (For 2026 Launch)

**Current State (2025):** Build trust, no selling.

**Future State (2026):** When ready to launch agency:
1. Announce career transition (left MoneyGram)
2. Formally launch agency brand
3. Shift from "helping friends" to "now accepting clients"
4. Leverage accumulated trust and case studies

**For Now:** Plant seeds. Build credibility. No selling.
