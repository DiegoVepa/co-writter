# Employer Safety Filter - Employment Protection Protocol

**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11

---

## Purpose

This is your **critical safety protocol** to protect current employment while building toward future opportunities. Every piece of content MUST pass through this filter before publication.

---

## Core Principle

**You are building skills and audience in public. You are NOT building an agency or offering services.**

---

## The Trust Doctrine (HARD RULE)

**Trust > Reach**

You cannot use language that implies organizational-level building if your organization knows you are not doing that.

Not because it's illegal.
Not because it's disallowed.
**But because it breaks trust with the people who know you best.**

### Why This Matters:

Your colleagues at MoneyGram see your LinkedIn. If your public content suggests you're building systems at organizational scale elsewhere, it creates cognitive dissonance:

- "He says he's building cycles for teams... but not here?"
- "Systems teams rely on? Is he doing this somewhere else?"
- "Things running without babysitting... where?"

This isn't paranoia. It's pattern recognition.

### The Forbidden Patterns:

❌ **NEVER use these phrases** unless explicitly tied to university work, personal projects, helping friends, or research:

- "building cycles"
- "systems teams rely on"
- "things running without babysitting"
- Any language implying org-wide ownership or multi-team impact
- Anything suggesting you're architecting for organizations (unless it's your DBA research)

---

## Three Approved Sources of Truth

When creating content, you have **three clean, defensible anchors**. All content must originate from one of these:

### 1. DBA / University Projects

**Status:** Bulletproof. Nobody at MoneyGram can question educational work.

**Approved Language:**
- ✅ "In my DBA program..."
- ✅ "As part of a university project..."
- ✅ "For a research study on..."
- ✅ "Academic work exploring..."
- ✅ "My doctoral research focuses on..."

**Why This Works:**
It's education. It's expected. It's encouraged. This is your strongest, safest anchor.

---

### 2. Personal Productivity Systems

**Status:** Safe. Not teams. Not orgs. Just you.

**Approved Language:**
- ✅ "How I structure my own work"
- ✅ "A personal workflow I built"
- ✅ "A setup I use to learn faster"
- ✅ "An experiment I ran for myself"
- ✅ "My personal productivity system"
- ✅ "How I organize my learning"

**Why This Works:**
This reads as: *"Senior IC improving his craft"*
NOT: *"Shadow PM/Engineer building systems elsewhere"*

**Example Reframes:**

Instead of: "I'm optimizing for smaller build cycles"
✅ Say: "I'm running short learning experiments"

Instead of: "systems that run without babysitting"
✅ Say: "setups I don't have to think about twice"

---

### 3. Helping Friends (Carefully Framed)

**Status:** Use sparingly and with precision.

**Approved Language:**
- ✅ "Helping a friend who runs an HVAC business"
- ✅ "Built this for a cousin's plumbing company"
- ✅ "Personal favor for a friend"
- ✅ "A family member asked me to..."
- ✅ "Testing this with a friend's small business"

**Critical Constraints:**
- One-off framing only (never imply repetition)
- Never imply scale ("helped multiple friends" = red flag)
- Always frame as favor, never as paid work
- Specific and humble

**Why This Works:**
Shows capability building without business implication.

## Language Substitution Guide

Use these approved replacements to communicate the same ideas safely:

### Building & Iteration:

| ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Approved |
|-------------|------------|
| "Optimizing for smaller build cycles" | "Running short learning experiments" |
| "Shipping faster iterations" | "Testing ideas in contained projects" |
| "Building in sprints" | "Shipping small personal experiments end-to-end" |

### Systems & Automation:

| ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Approved |
|-------------|------------|
| "Systems that run without babysitting" | "Setups I don't have to think about twice" |
| "Automated workflows for teams" | "Workflows that remove manual steps for me" |
| "Self-running processes" | "Processes I can trust once they're set up" |
| "Set-it-and-forget-it automation" | "Automation that fades into the background" |

### Scale & Impact:

| ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Approved |
|-------------|------------|
| "Systems teams rely on" | "A system I rely on" |
| "Building for organizations" | "Building for my own learning" |
| "Solving problems at scale" | "Testing solutions in small experiments" |
| "Enterprise-level solutions" | "Personal tools that might scale later" |

---

## The Three-Track Reality

| Track | Audience | Constraint |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Track 1: Employment Safety** | MoneyGram (implicit) | **NEVER** mention agency, moonlighting, client work, or services |
| **Track 2: Career Pivot** | US Tech Hiring Managers | Frame as skill development and internal projects |
| **Track 3: Agency Build** | US SMB Owners | Frame as "helping friends" - NEVER as paid client work |

**Track 1 is non-negotiable. If content violates this, DO NOT PUBLISH.**

---

## Red Flags (NEVER Use These)

### Agency/Business Language:
❌ "My agency"
❌ "My clients"
❌ "Recent client engagement"
❌ "Customer project"
❌ "Consulting services"
❌ "Available for hire"
❌ "DM me for help"
❌ "Book a call"
❌ "Pricing available upon request"
❌ "Currently accepting new clients"
❌ "My services include"
❌ "Let me help your business"

### Moonlighting Indicators:
❌ "Side business"
❌ "Freelance work"
❌ "After-hours projects for clients"
❌ "Weekend consulting"
❌ "Building my agency on the side"
❌ "Paid project for..."

### Service Offering Language:
❌ "I can help you with..."
❌ "Offering automation services"
❌ "Contact me for..."
❌ "My rates are..."
❌ "Packages starting at..."

---

## Green Flags (Safe Framing)

### Personal Development:
✅ "Personal project"
✅ "Learning experiment"
✅ "Skill development"
✅ "Testing an idea"
✅ "Building my portfolio"
✅ "Side project" (if clearly personal, not client work)

### Helping Friends/Family:
✅ "Helping a friend who runs..."
✅ "Built this for my cousin's business..."
✅ "A family member asked me to..."
✅ "Testing this with a friend's company..."
✅ "Personal favor for..."

### Internal Work:
✅ "At my company, I built..."
✅ "Internal project for my team..."
✅ "Workflow I created at work..."
✅ "Process I designed for our sales team..."

### Educational/Observational:
✅ "I've been studying how..."
✅ "Experimenting with..."
✅ "Researching automation for..."
✅ "Learning about..."

## Safe vs. Unsafe Examples

### Example 1: SMB Automation Post

❌ **UNSAFE:**
```
My client runs an HVAC company. I helped them reduce no-shows
by 60% using automated reminders.

If your business has the same problem, DM me. I offer automation
consulting for service businesses.
```

**Why Unsafe:**
- "My client" = implies paid work
- "I offer" = service offering
- "DM me" = solicitation

✅ **SAFE:**
```
I've been helping a friend automate his HVAC business. He was
losing $2K/month to no-shows.

Built him a simple reminder system in 45 minutes. No-shows dropped
60% in the first month.

Sometimes the best automation is just asking twice.

What's one process in your business you'd automate first?
```

**Why Safe:**
- "Helping a friend" = personal favor
- No service offering
- Ends with question, not sales pitch

---

### Example 2: Building Portfolio Post

❌ **UNSAFE:**
```
Recently completed an agency project for a local plumbing company.
Automated their entire quote process. Available for similar work.

Check out my portfolio: [link]
```

**Why Unsafe:**
- "Agency project" = business work
- "Available for similar work" = offering services
- Portfolio positioning as service provider

✅ **SAFE:**
```
Personal project this week: Built a quote automation system to test
an integration idea.

Used n8n + Claude API to pull product specs and auto-generate quotes.

Took 6 hours to build. Would've saved 25 hours/week if I'd done this
a year ago.

Key lesson: Most quote delays aren't about the quote. They're about
getting product specs into the template.

What's your biggest workflow bottleneck?
```

**Why Safe:**
- "Personal project" = skill development
- "Test an integration idea" = learning
- No client/customer mention
- Ends with discussion question

---

### Example 3: Thought Leadership Post

❌ **UNSAFE:**
```
The best AI opportunities are in boring businesses.

That's why my agency focuses exclusively on HVAC, plumbing,
and trades. We've helped 10+ service businesses automate
operations and save $100K+ annually.

Book a discovery call: [link]
```

**Why Unsafe:**
- "My agency" = business operation
- "We've helped" = paid clients
- "Book a call" = lead generation

✅ **SAFE:**
```
The best AI opportunities are in boring businesses.

Everyone's building AI chatbots for tech companies. Meanwhile,
HVAC companies are losing $2K/month to no-shows that could be
fixed with a 45-minute automation.

I've been experimenting with simple automations for service
businesses—the ROI is insane compared to enterprise AI projects.

Reminder systems. Invoice follow-ups. Quote automation.

Boring? Yes. Profitable? Extremely.

What's one boring business problem you think AI could solve?
```

**Why Safe:**
- "Experimenting with" = learning/testing
- No client mention
- No service offering
- Observation + question format

---

### Example 4: Intro Post (Trust Doctrine Applied)

This example demonstrates the Trust Doctrine in action—avoiding organizational-scale language while still positioning as a builder.

❌ **UNSAFE (violates Trust Doctrine):**
```
Over the last year, I've been optimizing for smaller build cycles.

I'm building systems teams can rely on—things that run without
constant babysitting.

My focus: shipping faster iterations, not endless research.

The best AI work happens when you build it into existing workflows,
not as standalone experiments.

What's one part of your workflow that still feels more manual than
it should?
```

**Why Unsafe:**
- "build cycles" = implies organizational development cadence
- "systems teams rely on" = suggests multi-team ownership
- "run without babysitting" = organizational-scale automation
- Creates cognitive dissonance: "Where is he building these systems? Not at MoneyGram..."

✅ **SAFE (Trust Doctrine compliant):**
```
Most AI content talks about what's possible.
I'm more interested in what actually gets used.

Over the last year—through university projects, personal experiments,
and a few "helping a friend" builds—I noticed a pattern in how I work:

Ideas don't fail because they're bad.
They fail because they never make it into a real routine.

The gap isn't intelligence.
It's integration.

What's working for me:
• Short, contained projects instead of endless research
• Personal workflows that remove friction from daily work
• Fewer demos, more setups I actually rely on

In practice, I'm using AI the same way I use notes, spreadsheets,
or dashboards: to learn faster, think more clearly, and apply ideas
immediately.

Not prompts for the sake of prompts.
Not tools for the sake of tools.

Just systems that earn their place by getting used.

I'll be sharing what I experiment with, what works, and what doesn't—
across academic projects, personal builds, and occasional favors for
friends.

Sometimes it'll work.
Sometimes it won't.

That's the point.

What's one part of your day that still feels more manual than it should?
```

**Why Safe:**
- ✅ Explicitly anchored to three approved sources (university, personal, helping friends)
- ✅ "Personal workflows" not "team systems"
- ✅ "Setups I rely on" not "systems teams rely on"
- ✅ "Short learning experiments" not "build cycles"
- ✅ 100% truthful and defensible
- ✅ Still strong positioning without organizational implications

**The Key Shift:**
- From: "I'm building systems for organizations"
- To: "I'm systematically building the capability to do this next"

This is powerful AND safe.

## Platform-Specific Risks

### LinkedIn (Highest Risk):
- Most visible to current employer
- Easiest to trace back to your professional identity
- Recruiters actively scan for signals

**Extra Caution:**
- Never mention agency work
- Frame everything as skill development
- Internal projects are safest content
- "Helping friends" framing acceptable but use sparingly

---

### X/Twitter (Medium Risk):
- Less formally tied to professional identity
- More casual tone expected
- Build-in-public culture

**Moderate Caution:**
- Can be more experimental
- Still no client/agency language
- "Personal projects" framing works well

---

### Substack (Lower Risk):
- Less employer visibility
- Longer-form allows nuanced framing
- Educational positioning natural

**Lower Caution:**
- Can discuss agency topics theoretically
- Still frame as research/learning
- No explicit service offering

---

## Red Flag Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Someone Asks for Help in Comments

**Comment:** "This is exactly what my business needs. Can you help?"

❌ **UNSAFE Response:**
"Yes, I offer automation consulting. DM me and we can discuss pricing."

✅ **SAFE Response:**
"Happy to point you in the right direction! The tools I used were n8n (free tier) and Twilio. There are some good tutorials on YouTube for setting up similar workflows. If you get stuck, feel free to reach out with specific questions."

---

### Scenario 2: Direct Message Asking About Services

**DM:** "I run an HVAC company. What would you charge to build this for me?"

❌ **UNSAFE Response:**
"My rate is $X/hour for automation projects. I can send you a proposal."

✅ **SAFE Response:**
"I appreciate the interest! Right now I'm focused on my full-time role and building skills for a career transition. That said, the tools I used are all accessible—happy to share resources if you want to tackle it yourself or find a contractor to help."

---

### Scenario 3: Recruiter Asks About "Agency Work" on Profile

**Message:** "I see you're running an automation agency. Are you open to full-time roles?"

❌ **UNSAFE Response:**
"Yes, I run a small agency on the side but I'm open to the right full-time opportunity."

✅ **SAFE Response:**
"Actually, those are personal projects and skill-building work—not client engagements. I'm exploring how AI and automation apply to different industries as I consider next career steps. Definitely open to the right full-time opportunity."

---

## Emergency Protocol

### If Employer Questions Your Content:

**If asked:** "Are you running a business on the side?"

**Response Template:**
"No, I'm not running a business. I've been working on personal projects to develop skills in AI and automation—it's relevant to [your current role] and I'm exploring potential career paths. Everything I post is either internal work projects or personal learning experiments."

**Follow-up action:**
- Review last 10 posts for any violations
- Edit or delete anything borderline
- Temporarily pause posting if needed
- Shift to 100% internal work content

---

## Month-by-Month Safety Guidance

### Months 1-6 (Now - Mid 2025):
**Strictness Level:** MAXIMUM

**Content Mix:**
- 60% Internal work projects (safest framing)
- 30% "Helping friends" (boring business + some builds)
- 10% Theoretical/educational (no project framing needed)

**Guidelines:**
- Zero service language
- Heavy skill development framing
- Always frame "helping friends" as personal favors, never paid work

**Rationale:** 30% "helping friends" allows you to build boring business credibility (which requires this framing) while maintaining employment safety through majority internal content.

### Months 7-12 (Mid 2025 - End 2025):
**Strictness Level:** HIGH

- More "helping friends" content (1 in 3 posts)
- Still zero service language
- Can discuss agency topics theoretically
- Focus on building credibility for future launch

### Month 13+ (2026 and beyond):
**Strictness Level:** DEPENDS ON EMPLOYMENT STATUS

- If still at MoneyGram: maintain high strictness
- If transitioned to new role: adjust based on new employer policy
- If left employment: can launch agency publicly

---

## Content Audit Process

### Monthly Review (Do This Every 30 Days):

1. **Review last month's posts**
   - Flag any that could be misinterpreted
   - Consider deleting borderline content

2. **Check engagement patterns**
   - Are people asking for services?
   - Are comments implying you run a business?
   - Adjust framing if needed

3. **Verify safety ratio**
   - At least 60% of content = internal work or skill development
   - No more than 30% = "helping friends" content
   - Up to 10% = theoretical/educational content
   - Zero = client/agency language

---

## When You Can Safely Shift

### Conditions Required to Start Offering Services:

1. **Employment Status Change:**
   - Left MoneyGram OR
   - New employer with explicit permission OR
   - New role allows side business

2. **Public Announcement:**
   - Clear career transition announcement
   - Formal agency launch
   - Update LinkedIn headline and summary

3. **Content Shift:**
   - Change framing from "helping friends" to "now accepting clients"
   - Can use client/customer language
   - Can include CTAs and service offerings

**Until all conditions are met: MAINTAIN SAFETY PROTOCOL.**

---

## Final Rule

**When in doubt, DON'T POST.**

If you're unsure whether content passes the employment safety filter, err on the side of caution:
- Revise to safer framing
- Remove risky language
- Add more "personal project" context
- Or skip the post entirely

**Your current job funds the runway to your next career. Protect it.**
