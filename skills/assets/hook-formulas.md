## Tier 1 Hooks (Use Most)

### 1. Contrarian Take

**Formula:**
"Most [people/companies] do X. [Unexpected alternative/truth]."

**Why It Works:**
- Challenges conventional wisdom
- Creates tension
- Promises fresh perspective

**Examples:**

```
Most AI pilots fail.

Not because the technology doesn't work—it usually does.
```

```
Everyone talks about prompts. The real leverage is in context.
```

```
Most companies don't need AI. They need to fix their broken processes first.
```

```
The best stack isn't the newest one.
```

```
Most sales teams automate the wrong things.

They focus on emails and sequences. The real bottleneck?
Getting product specs into quotes.
```

**When to Use:**
- Industry observations
- Lessons from experience
- Challenging hype or trends
- Product/process insights

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅ Shows independent thinking
- Agency Build: ✅ Cuts through noise

---

### 2. What I Built

**Formula:**
"Built [X] this week/month. [Quick outcome or hook detail]."

**Why It Works:**
- Immediately establishes credibility
- Promises practical demonstration
- Signals hands-on capability

**Examples:**

```
Built a workflow this week that cut quote turnaround from 2 days to 20 minutes.

Here's how product and sales became one system.
```

```
Just shipped a tool that automates something I used to spend 4 hours/week doing.

Cost: $0. Time to build: 45 minutes.
```

```
Spent the weekend building a lead scoring system that connects
CRM, product usage, and deal stage.

Early results: 34% faster activation.
```

```
Built an automation yesterday that I should've built a year ago.

Already saved 3 hours this week.
```

**When to Use:**
- After completing a build
- Showcasing technical capability
- Demonstrating ROI thinking
- Build-in-public updates

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅✅ Proves you can build
- Agency Build: ✅✅ Shows practical capability

---

### 3. Unexpected Reframe

**Formula:**
"Everyone's talking about [X]. The real [insight] is [Y]."
OR
"It's not about [obvious thing]. It's about [deeper insight]."

**Why It Works:**
- Acknowledges common view
- Offers deeper perspective
- Positions you as thoughtful

**Examples:**

```
Everyone's talking about AI replacing jobs.

The real shift? AI exposes which processes were broken all along.
```

```
It's not about the tool. It's about how it connects to everything else.
```

```
AI doesn't replace process. It exposes bad process faster.
```

```
The problem with most automations isn't the automation.

It's that nobody thought through the workflow it's replacing.
```

```
Everyone's building AI features for customers.

The best ROI? Internal operations nobody sees.
```

**When to Use:**
- Adding nuance to trending topics
- Sharing counter-intuitive lessons
- Thought leadership positioning
- Systems thinking demonstrations

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅✅ Shows product/strategic thinking
- Agency Build: ✅ Demonstrates depth

## Tier 2 Hooks (Use Regularly)

### 4. Before/After

**Formula:**
"Before: [Painful state]. After: [Improved state]."
OR
"[Metric before] → [Metric after]. Here's how."

**Why It Works:**
- Immediate, tangible value
- Clear transformation
- Promises specific outcome

**Examples:**

```
Before: 6 hours/week chasing unpaid invoices.
After: 15 minutes to set up automation, now runs itself.

Here's the breakdown.
```

```
Quote turnaround: 2 days → 20 minutes.

Here's what changed.
```

```
No-shows: 30% → 12% in 30 days.

Cost to fix: $15/month.

Here's how.
```

```
Used to spend 4 hours/week pulling data for Monday standups.

Now it takes 0 hours. Automated it in 45 minutes.

Thread on how 🧵
```

**When to Use:**
- Clear transformations
- ROI-driven stories
- Process improvements
- Tool/automation showcases

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅ Shows outcomes-thinking
- Agency Build: ✅✅ Tangible ROI proof

---

### 5. Problem-First

**Formula:**
"[Person/Company] was [struggling with X]. [Quick context about pain]."

**Why It Works:**
- Relatable entry point
- Creates empathy
- Sets up solution payoff

**Examples:**

```
My friend runs a plumbing company. He was losing $2K/month to no-shows.

People would book appointments, then just not answer the door.
```

```
Our sales team was waiting 2 days for product specs before they
could send quotes.

We were losing deals to faster competitors.
```

```
Every Monday morning, I spent 2 hours pulling data from 3 different
systems, cleaning it in Sheets, and formatting a standup report.

Boring. Repetitive. Soulless.
```

```
The biggest complaint from our sales team: "Product takes forever
to respond to customer questions."

The biggest complaint from product: "Sales keeps asking us the same
questions."

Both were right.
```

**When to Use:**
- "Helping a friend" stories
- Internal workflow improvements
- Relatable pain points
- Case studies

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅ Shows problem-solving
- Agency Build: ✅✅ Relatable and specific

---

### 6. Counter-Intuitive Insight

**Formula:**
"I used to think [common belief]. Then [experience that changed view]."
OR
"The [surprising thing] about [topic] is [unexpected insight]."

**Why It Works:**
- Demonstrates learning/growth
- Signals open-mindedness
- Creates curiosity about the shift

**Examples:**

```
I used to think sales was about closing deals.

Then I started treating it like product design.
```

```
The hardest part of automation isn't the automation.

It's getting people to trust it.
```

```
I thought HVAC companies would want an AI chatbot.

They just wanted to stop wasting gas on no-shows.
```

```
Spent 10 years in sales thinking the best reps were the best closers.

Turns out the best reps are the best qualifiers.
```

```
The most successful automation I've built? The one that does the
least.

Just sends two text reminders. That's it.
```

**When to Use:**
- Sharing lessons learned
- Challenging assumptions
- Reflecting on experience
- Thought leadership

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅✅ Shows evolution and learning
- Agency Build: ✅ Builds trust through honesty

---

## Tier 3 Hooks (Use Sparingly)

### 7. Personal Story

**Formula:**
"[Time period] ago, I [did something]. [Result or reflection]."

**Why It Works:**
- Humanizes you
- Creates relatability
- Can be emotionally engaging

**Examples:**

```
3 months ago, I didn't know how to code.

Yesterday I shipped an automation that saves my team 25 hours/week.

Here's what I learned.
```

```
In 10 years of selling, I never thought I'd be building internal tools.

Now it's my favorite part of the job.
```

```
Last year I manually did something 52 times.

This year I automated it. Now it happens automatically every week.

Why did I wait so long?
```

**When to Use:**
- Authentic vulnerable moments
- Career transition reflections
- Major milestones
- When personal context adds value

**Caution:** Can feel self-indulgent if overused.

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅ Signals growth and adaptability
- Agency Build: ✅ Builds human connection

---

### 8. Provocative Question

**Formula:**
"[Bold question that challenges reader's assumption]"

**Why It Works:**
- Engages reader immediately
- Creates mental tension
- Promises an answer

**Examples:**

```
Why do most AI implementations fail?

(Hint: It's not the AI.)
```

```
What if the best automation is the one your users never see?
```

```
When's the last time you automated something boring?

Not sexy. Not innovative. Just boring and repetitive.
```

```
What's worth more: A new feature or a faster workflow?

Most companies choose wrong.
```

**When to Use:**
- Opening thought leadership
- Framing a contrarian take
- Starting educational content

**Caution:** Can feel clickbait-y if the answer doesn't deliver.

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅ Shows thought leadership
- Agency Build: ⚠️ Use carefully (can feel salesy)

---

### 9. Bold Prediction

**Formula:**
"[Specific prediction about future]. Here's why."

**Why It Works:**
- Positions you as forward-thinking
- Creates debate/discussion
- Stakes a claim

**Examples:**

```
In 5 years, every service business will have at least one AI-powered
workflow.

Not because they're innovative. Because they can't afford not to.
```

```
The next wave of profitable AI companies won't sell to enterprises.

They'll sell $50/month automations to plumbers and electricians.
```

```
Most sales roles will become product roles in the next 3 years.

The people who survive? The ones building now.
```

**When to Use:**
- Industry trend observations
- Positioning yourself as thought leader
- Starting big-picture discussions

**Caution:** Can age poorly or sound presumptuous.

**Audience Fit:**
- Career Pivot: ✅ Shows strategic thinking
- Agency Build: ⚠️ Can feel disconnected from their reality

## Hook Formula Combinations

Sometimes the strongest hooks combine multiple formulas:

### Contrarian + What I Built:
```
Most sales teams automate the wrong things.

This week I built a workflow that automates the actual bottleneck:
getting product specs into quotes.

2 days → 20 minutes.
```

### Problem-First + Before/After:
```
My friend was losing $2K/month to no-shows.

Before: 30% no-show rate.
After: 12%.

Cost to fix: $15/month.
```

### Counter-Intuitive + Reframe:
```
I used to think automation was about saving time.

It's not. It's about reducing friction.

The time savings are just a side effect.
```

## Common Hook Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Too Vague
❌ "Here's something interesting about AI."
✅ "Most AI pilots fail because of integration, not the AI."

### Mistake 2: Burying the Lead
❌ "I've been thinking a lot about automation lately and wanted to share some thoughts about what I've learned after working on a few projects..."
✅ "Built a workflow this week that cut quote turnaround from 2 days to 20 minutes."

### Mistake 3: Clickbait Without Payoff
❌ "This one trick will change your business forever." (Then shares a generic tip)
✅ "Built a 45-minute automation that saves $2K/month. Here's how." (Then delivers specifics)

### Mistake 4: Too Generic
❌ "AI is changing everything."
✅ "Most companies don't need AI. They need to fix their broken processes first."

### Mistake 5: Humble-Bragging
❌ "Just closed the biggest deal of my career while also launching three new AI projects."
✅ "Built three automations this month. Two work great. One completely failed. Here's what I learned."
