# X/Twitter Thread Format

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-27

---

## Purpose

Quick, punchy threads for build-in-public updates, hot takes, and real-time insights. Use X for more casual, contrarian, and experimental content.

---

## When to Use Thread Format

✅ **Use for:**
- Build-in-public updates
- Hot takes and contrarian views
- Quick lessons from failures
- Live project updates
- Behind-the-scenes of a build
- Expanding a single insight into 5-10 tweets

❌ **Don't use for:**
- Long-form explanations (use LinkedIn or Substack)
- Professional positioning (use LinkedIn)
- Anything requiring visual frameworks (use carousel)

---

## Thread Length Guidelines

- **Minimum:** 3 tweets
- **Optimal:** 5-7 tweets
- **Maximum:** 10 tweets
- **Per tweet:** 1-3 sentences max

---

## Thread Structure Template

### Option 1: Build-in-Public Thread

```
Tweet 1: [Hook - What you're building/shipping]
Tweet 2: [Why you're building it]
Tweet 3: [What you tried first that didn't work]
Tweet 4: [What you're trying now]
Tweet 5: [Current status or early result]
Tweet 6: [Key lesson or insight]
Tweet 7: [CTA or question]
```

### Option 2: Hot Take Thread

```
Tweet 1: [Contrarian statement]
Tweet 2: [Why most people get this wrong]
Tweet 3: [Evidence or example]
Tweet 4: [The real insight]
Tweet 5: [What to do instead]
Tweet 6: [Conclusion or CTA]
```

### Option 3: Lesson Thread

```
Tweet 1: [Hook - What you learned the hard way]
Tweet 2: [The mistake or wrong assumption]
Tweet 3: [What happened as a result]
Tweet 4: [The turning point]
Tweet 5: [What you'd do differently]
Tweet 6: [Broader lesson]
Tweet 7: [Question to audience]
```

## Tweet 1: The Hook

**Purpose:** Stop the scroll. Make them click "Show more."

### Hook Formulas:

**Contrarian Take:**
```
Most AI implementations fail.

Not because of the AI.

Thread on what actually breaks 🧵
```

**Build Announcement:**
```
Just shipped a tool that cut our quote process from 2 days to 20 minutes.

Built it in 6 hours with free-tier tools.

Here's how 🧵
```

**Lesson Learned:**
```
I wasted 3 months building the wrong thing.

Here's what I'd do differently 🧵
```

**Behind the Scenes:**
```
Currently debugging the dumbest bug of my career.

AI is supposed to make this easier, right?

Live thread 🧵
```

## Tone & Voice for X/Twitter

### More Casual Than LinkedIn:
- Shorter sentences
- More personality
- Less formal language
- More humor (if authentic)

### More Contrarian:
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Hot takes are encouraged
- Be willing to be wrong publicly

### More Transparent:
- Share failures openly
- Show works-in-progress
- Admit when you don't know something

---

## Character Count Strategy

### Optimal Length Per Tweet:
- **Under 280 characters** is ideal (fits in one view)
- **240 characters or less** is even better (easier to read)
- Break long thoughts into multiple tweets

### Formatting Tips:
- Use line breaks liberally
- One idea per tweet
- White space improves readability

---

## Example Threads by Type

### Example 1: Build-in-Public Thread

```
Tweet 1:
Just automated something that was taking 4 hours/week.

Built it in 45 minutes using n8n + Claude API.

Cost: $0

Thread on how 🧵

---

Tweet 2:
The problem:

Every week I manually pulled data from 3 different sources,
cleaned it in Google Sheets, then formatted it for our Monday
standup report.

Boring. Repetitive. Soulless.

---

Tweet 3:
First attempt: Tried to use Zapier.

Hit paywall immediately. Their free tier doesn't support
multi-step workflows.

Pass.

---

Tweet 4:
Second attempt: n8n (open source, self-hosted).

Free tier is generous. Can handle complex workflows.

Connected it to:
→ CRM API
→ Project management tool
→ Google Sheets
→ Slack

---

Tweet 5:
The magic: Claude API for data cleaning.

Instead of writing rules for every edge case, I just
feed Claude the messy data + instructions.

It formats it better than my manual process ever did.

---

Tweet 6:
Results after 2 weeks:
→ 4 hours/week saved
→ Zero manual data entry
→ Report is actually MORE accurate
→ Total cost: $0

---

Tweet 7:
Key lesson: Most people overthink automation.

Start with the boring stuff you hate doing.
Build a quick solution.
Ship it.

What's one thing you'd automate first?
```

---

### Example 2: Hot Take Thread

```
Tweet 1:
Hot take:

Most companies don't need AI.

They need to fix their broken processes first.

Thread 🧵

---

Tweet 2:
Here's what I see over and over:

Company has a manual, inefficient workflow.

Instead of fixing the workflow, they throw AI at it.

Now they have an automated mess.

---

Tweet 3:
Example:

Sales team manually enters lead data into 3 different tools.

Their solution? "Let's use AI to auto-fill the fields!"

Better solution? "Why are we using 3 tools for one job?"

---

Tweet 4:
AI doesn't replace strategy.

It amplifies whatever you're already doing.

Good process + AI = massive leverage.
Bad process + AI = faster failure.

---

Tweet 5:
Before you automate:

1. Map your current process
2. Identify redundant steps
3. Simplify first
4. Then (and only then) automate

---

Tweet 6:
The best AI projects I've seen?

They automated something that was ALREADY working well manually.

The worst? They tried to "fix" something broken by making it faster.

---

Tweet 7:
Bottom line:

Process before technology.
Simplicity before complexity.
Manual success before automated scale.

What's a process you simplified before automating?
```

---

### Example 3: Lesson Thread

```
Tweet 1:
I spent 3 months building a tool nobody wanted.

Here's what I learned 🧵

---

Tweet 2:
The idea: An AI-powered dashboard for sales teams to
track deal sentiment.

Seemed obvious. Sales teams need better insights, right?

Built it. Demoed it. Crickets.

---

Tweet 3:
The mistake: I never asked if they actually wanted this.

I assumed they had the problem.
I assumed they'd change their workflow to use my solution.

Both assumptions were wrong.

---

Tweet 4:
What actually happened:

Reps already had a system (messy spreadsheets + gut feel).

My tool required them to:
→ Change their process
→ Learn new software
→ Trust an AI they didn't understand

Too much friction.

---

Tweet 5:
The turning point:

I showed it to a friend who said:
"This is cool, but I'd never use it. Can you just fix
the part where I manually pull data every Monday?"

One boring automation. That's all he wanted.

---

Tweet 6:
So I pivoted.

Stopped building features.
Started solving one annoying task at a time.

Built 5 small automations in the time I spent on
the "big idea."

All 5 got adopted immediately.

---

Tweet 7:
Key lesson: Solve the boring problem in front of you.

Not the sexy problem you think they should have.

What's one "boring" automation you actually use daily?
```

---

## Engagement Strategies

### End with a Question:
✅ "What's one process you'd automate first?"
✅ "Anyone else seeing this pattern?"
✅ "What am I missing here?"

### Invite Sharing:
✅ "Drop your best automation tip below."
✅ "What's working for you?"
✅ "Curious what tools you're using for this."

### Call for Stories:
✅ "What's the dumbest bug you've encountered?"
✅ "Share your worst AI implementation story."

---

## Safety Filters (Employment Safety)

**Same rules apply as LinkedIn:**

❌ NEVER mention:
- Client work
- Agency services
- Offering consulting
- "DM me for help"

✅ ALWAYS frame as:
- Personal projects
- Helping friends
- Experiments
- Learning in public

---

## When to Thread vs. Single Tweet

### Use Thread When:
- Story needs context (3+ connected ideas)
- Build-in-public update with steps
- Hot take that requires explanation

### Use Single Tweet When:
- Quick insight stands alone
- Simple observation
- Sharing a link to longer content

---

## Visual Content for Threads

### What Works on X:
- Screenshots of builds
- Simple charts or graphs
- Before/after comparisons
- Code snippets (syntax highlighted)
- Personal photos (sparingly)

### What Doesn't Work:
- Heavy carousel-style PDFs (use LinkedIn)
- Walls of text as images
- Overly designed graphics

---

## Quality Checklist

Before posting thread, verify:

- [ ] Tweet 1 hooks within first sentence
- [ ] Each tweet is under 280 characters
- [ ] One idea per tweet
- [ ] Thread has clear arc (hook → insight → CTA)
- [ ] Ends with engagement question
- [ ] Passes employment safety filter
- [ ] Authentic voice (not corporate)
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Visual content enhances (if applicable)

---

## Integration with Other Platforms

### X → LinkedIn Flow:
1. Test idea on X as thread
2. If it performs well, expand into LinkedIn post
3. Link back to X thread for discussion

### X → Substack Flow:
1. Share Substack essays as threads (summary version)
2. Drive traffic to full essay with link in final tweet
