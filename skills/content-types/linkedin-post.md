## Purpose

Standard LinkedIn post format for thought leadership, insights, and quick builds. This is the workhorse content format—use it 60-70% of the time.

---

## Structure Template

```
[HOOK - 1-2 punchy sentences]

[SETUP - Context or problem, 2-3 sentences]

[BUILD/INSIGHT - What you did or learned, 3-5 sentences]

[PAYOFF - Key takeaway, 1-2 sentences]

[ENGAGEMENT QUESTION - Invite response]
```

---

## Length Guidelines

- **Minimum:** 150 words
- **Optimal:** 200-300 words
- **Maximum:** 500 words (only for deep insights)
- **Paragraph length:** 1-3 sentences max per paragraph
- **White space:** Break up text frequently

---

## Hook Formulas (Priority Order)

### 1. Contrarian Take (Use Most)
- "Most [people/companies] do X. Here's why that fails."
- "Everyone talks about X. The real issue is Y."
- "The best [X] isn't the newest one."

**Example:**
```
Most AI pilots fail.

Not because the technology doesn't work—it usually does.
They fail because nobody figured out how to connect the shiny
new tool to the boring daily workflow.
```

### 2. What I Built (Credibility Builder)
- "This week I automated something that used to take 4 hours."
- "Built a workflow that replaced 3 manual processes."
- "Here's a system I created to solve [specific problem]."

**Example:**
```
Built a workflow this week that cut our quote turnaround from
2 days to 20 minutes.

Here's what worked (and what didn't).
```

### 3. Reframe (Shows Depth)
- "Everyone's talking about prompts. The real leverage is in context."
- "The problem isn't the tool. It's how it connects to everything else."
- "AI doesn't replace process. It exposes bad process faster."

**Example:**
```
The problem with most AI implementations isn't the AI.

It's that you automated a broken process, and now the
brokenness happens faster.
```

## Setup Patterns

### For Career Audience (Product/Marketing):
- Focus on system/process problems
- Use product language (adoption, workflow, integration)
- Frame as cross-functional challenge

**Example:**
```
When I built our internal lead scoring system, I realized
the real bottleneck wasn't deal volume—it was how long it
took prospects to experience value.
```

### For Agency Audience (SMB Owners):
- Focus on time/money waste
- Use plain language (no-shows, follow-ups, headaches)
- Frame as helping a friend

**Example:**
```
My friend runs a plumbing company. He was losing $2K/month
to no-shows. People would book appointments, then just not
answer the door.
```

---

## Build/Insight Section

### What to Include:
- Specific action you took
- Tools/approach used (briefly)
- Concrete results (numbers preferred)
- What surprised you or what you learned

### What to Avoid:
- Vague claims without specifics
- Jargon without explanation
- Tool features without outcomes
- Selling or pitching

**Good Example:**
```
So I designed a workflow that bridged sales handoff and
product onboarding. It automatically triggered onboarding
sequences based on deal stage.

Result: 34% faster time-to-first-value, which turned into
a 19% lift in close rate.
```

**Bad Example:**
```
I leveraged cutting-edge AI to transform our sales process
with a scalable, AI-powered solution that optimized our
entire funnel.
```

---

## Payoff Patterns

### Insight Payoff (Preferred):
- Single sentence that reframes the topic
- Should feel like an "aha" moment
- Connect to broader principle

**Examples:**
- "Sales and product aren't separate funnels. They're one system."
- "Integration beats innovation."
- "The best automation is invisible to the user."
- "Start with the boring stuff. That's where the leverage is."

### Action Payoff (When Sharing Framework):
- Clear next step reader can take
- Should be specific and actionable

**Examples:**
- "Start with one manual process you do weekly. Ask: could AI do 80% of this?"
- "Map your handoffs first. Automate second."

---

## Engagement Questions

### Strong Engagement Questions:
- "What's one process you'd automate first?"
- "Anyone else seeing this pattern?"
- "How are you connecting GTM and product at your company?"
- "What's the most boring task you automated this month?"

### Weak Engagement Questions:
- "What do you think?" (too vague)
- "Agree?" (yes/no, low engagement)
- "Thoughts?" (lazy)

---

## Formatting Rules

### White Space:
- One idea per paragraph
- Break after every 2-3 sentences
- Use line breaks liberally

### Emoji Usage:
- Sparingly (max 2-3 per post)
- 👉 for CTAs
- 📌 for links
- NO emoji bullets or decorative use

### Bold/Italics:
- Bold for key phrases (max 1-2 per post)
- NO ALL CAPS
- NO excessive formatting

### Hashtags:
- Maximum 3
- Place at end of post
- Relevant to content only
- Examples: #AIinBusiness #ProductOps #Automation

---

## Visual Accompaniment

### When to Add Images:
- Showing a build or workflow
- Before/after comparisons
- Framework diagrams
- Personal photo (sparingly)

### When to Skip Images:
- Thought leadership posts
- Quick insights
- When text carries the full message

---

## Tone & Voice

### Sentence Rhythm:
```
Short punchy statement.

Longer explanatory context that builds the idea.

Short insight.
```

### Voice Characteristics:
- **Conversational:** Write like you're explaining to a colleague
- **Humble:** Share learnings, not achievements
- **Practical:** Always tie to real outcomes
- **Specific:** Use numbers, tools, concrete examples

### Words to Use:
✅ built | designed | tested | learned | failed | discovered | realized | noticed

### Words to Avoid:
❌ revolutionary | cutting-edge | game-changing | transform | disrupt | leverage (overused)

---

## Safety Filters

### Employment Safety (CRITICAL):
❌ NEVER mention:
- Client work or agency services
- Offering consulting
- Moonlighting or side business
- "Available for hire" language

✅ ALWAYS frame as:
- Personal projects
- Helping friends
- Learning experiments
- Skills development

### Example Safe Framing:
```
✅ "I've been helping a friend automate their HVAC business..."
✅ "Built this as a personal project to test an idea..."
✅ "Experimenting with automation for local service businesses..."

❌ "My recent client engagement..."
❌ "My agency specializes in..."
❌ "DM me if you need help with..."
```

## Examples by Audience

### Career Pivot Audience Example:

```
Most sales teams measure revenue. I started measuring activation.

When I built our internal lead scoring system, I realized the real
bottleneck wasn't deal volume—it was how long it took prospects to
experience value.

So I designed a workflow that bridged sales handoff and product
onboarding. It automatically triggered onboarding sequences based
on deal stage.

Result: 34% faster time-to-first-value, which turned into a 19%
lift in close rate.

Sales and product aren't separate funnels. They're one system.

How are you connecting GTM and product at your company?
```

### Agency Build Audience Example:

```
My friend runs a plumbing company. He was losing $2K/month to no-shows.

People would book appointments, then just not answer the door.
No call, no reschedule.

I built him a simple reminder system: automated text 24 hours before,
another at 2 hours. If they don't confirm the 2-hour text, the system
flags it so he doesn't waste the drive.

Results:
- Cost to set up: $0 (used free tier tools)
- Time to build: 45 minutes
- No-shows dropped: 60%

Sometimes the best automation is just asking twice.

What's one process in your business you'd automate first?
```

## When NOT to Use This Format

Use a different format when:
- Content needs visual framework → Use carousel format

- Quick insight/hot take → Use X/Twitter thread
- Multi-part story → Use Substack essay
