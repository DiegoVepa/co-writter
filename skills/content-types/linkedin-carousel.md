Step 2: Map Your Handoff Points

Where does sales end and product begin?

Most companies have 3-5 critical handoffs:
→ Lead to MQL
→ MQL to Sales Qualified
→ Deal Close to Onboarding Start
→ Onboarding to Product Adoption

The gaps between these are where deals die.
```

**Example Content Slide (Agency Audience):**
```
Automation #2: Appointment Reminders

Cost: $0/month | Time to Build: 30 minutes

What it does:
→ Text 24hrs before appointment
→ Text 2hrs before appointment
→ Flags non-confirmations

Result: 60% drop in no-shows
```

### Final Slide - CTA/Summary

**Format:**
```
[KEY TAKEAWAY]
Main insight in 1-2 sentences

[CALL TO ACTION]
What you want reader to do next

[LINK/CONTACT]
Profile link, Substack, or connection invite
```

**Examples:**

**Insight-Focused CTA:**
```
The Bottom Line

Integration > Innovation

Start with the boring handoffs.
That's where the leverage is.

## When NOT to Use Carousel

Don't force carousel format when:

- Content feels like recycled generic advice

**Remember:** Carousels should provide genuine value, not just packaging.
