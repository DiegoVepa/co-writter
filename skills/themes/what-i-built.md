# Theme: "What I Built" Content Pillar

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-27

---

## Purpose

"What I Built" is your primary credibility-building content pillar. This theme demonstrates technical capability, product thinking, and hands-on execution—critical for both Career Pivot and Agency Build audiences.

**Use this theme:** 40-50% of your content

---

## Core Format

```
Problem → Build → Results → Lesson
```

Every "What I Built" post follows this structure:
1. **Problem:** What wasn't working (specific, relatable)
2. **Build:** What you created (technical but accessible)
3. **Results:** What changed (quantified outcomes)
4. **Lesson:** Transferable insight (broader application)

---

## Why This Theme Works

### For Career Pivot Audience:
✅ Demonstrates you can actually build things (not just talk about them)
✅ Shows product thinking and systems design
✅ Proves technical capability without a CS degree
✅ Signals cross-functional experience (sales + product + ops)

### For Agency Build Audience:
✅ Proves you've done this before (trust through specificity)
✅ Shows practical, ROI-driven solutions
✅ Demonstrates understanding of real business problems
✅ Makes automation tangible and accessible

## Content Subcategories

### 1. Internal Tools & Workflows
**Audience:** Primarily Career Pivot (but can work for both)

**Topics:**
- Quote generation automation
- Lead scoring systems
- Sales-to-product handoff workflows
- Internal dashboards
- Data integration projects
- CRM enhancements

**Example Hook:**
```
Built a workflow this week that cut quote turnaround from 2 days to 20 minutes.

Here's how product and sales became one system.
```

**Safe Framing:**
✅ "At my company, I built..."
✅ "Internal project for our team..."
✅ "Designed this to solve a bottleneck we had..."

---

### 2. "Helping Friends" Automation
**Audience:** Primarily Agency Build (SMB owners)

**Topics:**
- Appointment reminder systems
- Invoice automation
- Review request workflows
- Missed call auto-response
- Quote follow-up automation
- Scheduling optimization

**Example Hook:**
```
My friend runs a plumbing company. He was losing $2K/month to no-shows.

Here's what we built in 45 minutes.
```

**Safe Framing:**
✅ "Helping a friend who runs..."
✅ "Built this for my cousin's business..."
✅ "Personal project for a family member..."

❌ NEVER: "My client..." or "Agency project..."

---

### 3. Personal Experiments
**Audience:** Both (versatile)

**Topics:**
- Testing new AI tools
- Building portfolio projects
- Learning new integrations
- Proof-of-concept builds
- Exploring automation ideas

**Example Hook:**
```
Spent the weekend testing whether Claude API could replace a rules-based system.

Results: Better than expected. Here's what I learned.
```

**Safe Framing:**
✅ "Personal experiment to test..."
✅ "Built this to learn..."
✅ "Side project exploring..."

---

## Build Complexity Spectrum

### Quick Wins (45 min - 2 hours)
**Best for:** Agency Build audience, X/Twitter threads

**Examples:**
- Appointment reminder automation
- Simple webhook integrations
- Text/email automation
- Calendar sync workflows

**Value:** Shows simplicity and speed to value

**Hook Pattern:**
"Built in 45 minutes. Saved 5 hours/week. Cost: $0."

---

### Medium Builds (3-8 hours)
**Best for:** Both audiences, LinkedIn posts

**Examples:**
- Multi-step workflows (3-4 integrations)
- Data transformation pipelines
- Lead scoring systems
- Quote automation with logic

**Value:** Shows capability without overwhelming

**Hook Pattern:**
"Spent 6 hours building this. Saved 25 hours/week for the team."

---

### Complex Projects (Multiple days/weeks)
**Best for:** Career Pivot audience, case studies, Substack

**Examples:**
- Full system integrations
- Custom internal tools
- Multi-system architectures
- Product-sales workflow bridges

**Value:** Demonstrates deep technical and strategic thinking

**Hook Pattern:**
"Spent 3 weeks designing and building this. Changed how our entire team works."

---

## Technical Detail Balance

### Too Little Detail (Vague):
❌ "I used AI to automate our sales process."
❌ "Built a tool that makes things faster."
❌ "Integrated some systems to improve workflow."

**Problem:** No credibility. Could be made up.

---

### Right Amount of Detail (Credible):
✅ "Used n8n to connect CRM webhooks to Claude API, which matches customer requirements to product specs, then auto-populates our quote template."

✅ "Built a Calendly → Twilio → n8n workflow. Sends automated reminders at 24hrs and 2hrs before appointments."

**Why it works:** Specific enough to believe, accessible enough to understand.

---

### Too Much Detail (Overwhelming):
❌ "Configured OAuth2 authentication flow with refresh token rotation, implemented retry logic with exponential backoff, and set up webhook validation using HMAC-SHA256 signatures..."

**Problem:** Loses non-technical audience. Feels like showing off.

---

## Results: How to Quantify

### Strong Quantification:
✅ "Quote turnaround: 2 days → 20 minutes"
✅ "No-shows: 30% → 12%"
✅ "Time saved: 25 hours/week"
✅ "Revenue recovered: $2,400/month"
✅ "ROI: 160x in first month"
✅ "Setup cost: $0, Monthly cost: $15"

### Weak Quantification:
❌ "Much faster"
❌ "Significantly improved"
❌ "Better efficiency"
❌ "Positive results"

**Rule:** If you can't quantify, include qualitative but specific outcomes:
✅ "Team stopped asking me for help every day"
✅ "No more manual copy-paste between systems"
✅ "Reps can now quote same-day instead of waiting for product"

## Lesson Framework

Every "What I Built" post should end with a **transferable insight**—a principle others can apply.

### Lesson Patterns:

**Integration over Innovation:**
```
Key lesson: The AI was 20% of the value. Connecting it to systems people already used was 80%.
```

**Simplicity over Complexity:**
```
Biggest takeaway: I spent 3 hours trying to perfect v1. Should've shipped the 60% solution in 45 minutes and iterated.
```

**Boring over Sexy:**
```
Sometimes the best automation is just asking twice. Boring? Yes. ROI in week one? Also yes.
```

**Process before Technology:**
```
The problem wasn't the tool. It was that we automated a broken process, and now the brokenness happens faster.
```

**User Adoption over Features:**
```
If I'd built a standalone tool, nobody would have adopted it. Integration into existing workflow was everything.
```

## Frequency & Cadence

### Recommended Posting Schedule:

**LinkedIn:**
- 2-3 "What I Built" posts per month
- Mix of internal tools (Career) and "helping friends" (Agency)
- Space them out (don't cluster)

**X/Twitter:**

- Can be shorter/simpler builds
- More experimental, build-in-public tone

**Substack:**
- 1 deep-dive "What I Built" per month
- Full case study format
- Technical breakdown + lessons

---

## Build Documentation Strategy

### As You Build, Capture:

**During the Build:**
- Screenshots of workflow (before you clean it up)
- Notes on what didn't work
- Time spent on each phase
- Costs (tools, API calls, etc.)

**After the Build:**
- Final workflow screenshot
- Before/after metrics
- User feedback or team reaction
- What you'd do differently

**Why:** Makes writing content 10x faster. Capture in the moment, write later.

## Example: Full "What I Built" Post

### For Career Pivot Audience:

```
Built a workflow this week that cut quote turnaround from 2 days to 20 minutes.

The problem:
Reps would submit quote requests, wait 24-48hrs for product specs,
then manually copy-paste into templates. For complex deals: up to a week.

We were losing to competitors who could quote same-day.

The build:
→ n8n workflow triggered by CRM webhook
→ Claude API matches requirements to product specs
→ Auto-populates quote template with pricing
→ Sends completed quote to rep via email + CRM

Why this stack?
• n8n: Free tier, easy to maintain
• Claude: Better at nuanced matching than rules
• Webhooks: Real-time, no polling

What didn't work:
First attempt used IF/THEN rules. Worked for simple quotes, broke
on anything custom. Claude cut logic complexity by 80%.

Results:
• Turnaround: 2 days → 20 minutes
• Time saved: 25 hours/week (50 quotes × 30min each)
• Close rate: +19% (faster quotes = more wins)

Key lesson: Integration beats innovation.

The AI was 20% of the value. Connecting it to systems people
already used was 80%.

What's the biggest bottleneck between your sales and product teams?

### For Agency Build Audience:

```
My friend runs a plumbing company. He was losing $2K/month to no-shows.

The problem:
He'd book 10 appointments, drive to 8 locations, and 3 wouldn't
answer the door. 30% of his day wasted.

The build:
Simple two-part reminder:
→ Text 24hrs before with confirmation link
→ Text 2hrs before if not confirmed
→ System flags appointment if still no confirmation

Tools:
• Calendly (already using it)
• Twilio ($0.0079 per text)
• n8n (free tier)

Setup: $0 | Build time: 45 min | Monthly: $15

What didn't work:
Tried building a custom scheduling system from scratch. Took 3 hours,
broke twice, he hated it. Pivoted to enhancing his existing Calendly
instead.

Results after 30 days:
• No-shows: 30% → 12%
• Revenue recovered: $2,400/month
• Time saved: 6hrs/week
• ROI: 160x

Biggest takeaway: Start with the boring stuff.

Sexy automation is an AI chatbot. Boring automation fixes no-shows.
But boring automation has ROI in week one.

What's one boring process in your business you'd automate first?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Building Without Documenting
**Problem:** You forget details by the time you write the post.
**Fix:** Take screenshots and notes as you build.

### Mistake 2: Too Technical
**Problem:** Audience can't follow or relate.
**Fix:** Explain "what it does" before "how it works."

### Mistake 3: No Real Outcome
**Problem:** Sounds hypothetical or made-up.
**Fix:** Wait until you have real results to post.

### Mistake 4: Humble-Bragging
**Problem:** Comes across as showing off.
**Fix:** Frame as "here's what I learned" not "look how smart I am."

### Mistake 5: No Transferable Lesson
**Problem:** Just a project update, no value for reader.
**Fix:** Always end with insight others can apply.
