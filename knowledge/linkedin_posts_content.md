**Title:** 2026 won't wait for anyone.

Few days ago, I published an article in Mercado Negro Advertising about some technological trends that are already beginning to define the course of the coming years in Peru.

In recent months, I have seen how technology has ceased to be optional and has begun to influence how we work and make decisions.

Looking ahead to 2026, I believe that those who take the time to understand these changes and try them out will make a difference.

**Title:** Will AI dominate video production for social media?

A weeks ago, I listened to a podcast by Matthew Berman with Alex Mashrabov, the CEO of Higgsfield AI. And one line stuck with me: "AI is going to dominate video production on social media."

What really hits me is that it's already happening. A small business can now make videos that look like they came from a big company, without a big budget. Same fight for attention, but the field is finally more even.

We're entering a moment where any business can tell its story with pro-level quality. And to me, that changes everything.

**Title:** Google has finally woken up.

Gemini 3.0 changed the way I see Google. For months, I felt that they had everything they needed to lead in AI, but something was missing. This time, they've made the leap. The model is fast, solid, and useful in real tasks. Not only does it perform well in tests, but it also works in business scenarios where it previously fell short.

Even so, I still use other models for programming, but it's impossible to ignore how strong Google is now. Especially in multimodal and long processes that need order and precision.

**Title:** Put AI to work for your 2026 strategy.

Integrating AI means using it to think better and test faster. Start simple: have it challenge your plan, show you new angles, and help you see your strategy from a different perspective.

Then test, adjust, and iterate again. AI doesn't replace your judgment, but it speeds up decisions and prevents costly mistakes.

When your strategy works, AI helps automate messaging, improve ads, and amplify what's already working.

**Title:** The real leap is integrating AI.

In recent months, I've seen the same thing: many companies are excited about "trying AI," but few manage to make it work alongside what they already use. That's why a McKinsey & Company chart caught my attention because it shows that the organizations that move forward are the ones that integrate AI into their daily work and connect it to real results.

When AI helps speed up tasks, reduce friction, and make better decisions, it stops being an experiment and becomes part of the job.

That's why I think the most important step is to get used to using it every day. When it happens, the organization moves faster without anyone even noticing.

A week ago, I received the certificate from a talk I gave in September at the Ministerio de la Producción del Perú. It was a session with entrepreneurs where we talked about how AI can help them strengthen their businesses.

Thanks to the Ministry of Production for the invitation and for continuing to promote digital transformation for more entrepreneurs. These are the kinds of spaces that are always worth repeating.

**Title:** When customization becomes a bottleneck.

I recently mentioned that customizing without a solid base can slow things down more than it helps.

I saw this again when I collaborated on a project for an app. We added three features that seemed quick and ended up generating bugs and extra work.

Now the rule is simple: first, make sure the essentials work well, then move on to the rest. Customize, yes, but don't complicate everything.

**Title:** Cursor 2.0 arrived and changed how I build.

Cursor was my second IDE. With it, I learned to test ideas, combine technologies, and build small projects.

Version 2.0 surprised me: less time writing lines, more time managing agents and reviewing results. Several agents work in parallel, and the integrated browser allows you to see changes live without leaving the IDE.

Now I continue to combine worlds: the speed of Cursor 2.0 with the clarity and guidance of Claude. I like where this new way of programming is headed.

**Title:** A few days ago, I published an article in Mercado Negro Advertising...

...on a topic that I see recurring in many businesses: they are still not taking advantage of AI in their day-to-day operations.

AI can be a great ally: it helps serve customers, optimize tasks, and create content more efficiently. The key is choosing the right tools and learning how to get the most out of them.

**Title:** From zero to 20 projects: what I learned with AI

In 2024, I decided to learn something completely new. I didn't know where it would take me, but I was sure that AI would be my ally.

In April 2025, I finished my first personal project. Since then, I've spent my weekends working on different projects, helping friends and family turn their ideas into real apps and websites. Each project taught me something new and motivated me to keep experimenting.

Last week, a colleague said to me, "If we don't use AI to improve, we're not taking advantage of it." That phrase stuck with me. I'm sure AI doesn't replace people, but those who learn to use it advance faster and create more impact.

My first project was small, but it became the spark that continues to drive me to learn and create every weekend.

**Title:** A few months ago, while setting up the first websites for my projects...

I realized that no matter how much you love your favorite stack, none of that matters if it doesn't fit what the client really needs.

Sometimes I would come up with ideas for new sections or features. But all I had to do was talk to the user to understand that they were looking for something simpler: for everything to flow smoothly and without extra steps.

That's when I understood that customization isn't always about adding. It's about adjusting. Changing a technology if necessary, moving a detail, or simplifying a flow so that everything makes sense. The solutions that work best are those that maintain the essence without complicating the experience.

In the end, the key is knowing what to add and what to leave out.

**Title:** Not all updates mean progress ☝🏼

A while ago, we were building a website for my girlfriend's local business. The idea was to add new sections and features. Until we realized that customers didn't need more tools, they just wanted to place their orders without any complications.

So we stopped. We didn't add anything else. We focused on making the ordering process quick and clear. And it worked.

Over time, I realized that moving forward isn't always about creating something new, but about perfecting what already exists. One stable and useful feature is worth more than three that no one uses.

The real skill is knowing when to innovate and when to improve what already works.

👉🏼 In my chart, I share the process I use to decide whether to create or improve.

**Title:** I used to be loyal to Google Chrome.

For years, it was the only browser I used. But this year I tried other options: Arc, DIA Browser, Comet, and, more recently, Atlas from OpenAI. They all promise AI, but the real difference is how useful it is in your day-to-day life.

After trying them all, I stuck with Comet. Atlas has good integration with ChatGPT, but it's still finding its feet. Comet, on the other hand, already solves real tasks. It applies coupons, analyzes dashboards, summarizes pages, and organizes tabs without extra add-ons.

We are entering a new era: the browser is not just where we search for information, it's where we work. The key is not how much AI it has, but how it turns your intention into action.

**Title:** Not every business needs a chatbot.

What every business does need is clarity.

Recently, during a workshop with the Ministry of Production, someone asked me: "Do we need a chatbot to improve customer service?"

That question hit deeper than it seems.

Because many times the conversation starts with the tool, not with the problem.

I've seen chatbots launched without understanding the user, without defining the conversation flow, and without deciding when a human should step in. The result is usually the same: something that responds quickly, but doesn't actually help.

The value is not in the chatbot itself.

The value is in designing an experience that really solves something.

AI can interpret intentions, learn from each interaction, and improve over time.

But none of that works if there's no clear strategy behind it.

Automating without purpose is just adding noise.

Sometimes the smartest move isn't building more automation, is understanding the pain first.

**Title:** The difference isn't in AI, but in how you make it work for your strategy.

I recently reviewed the Latin American Artificial Intelligence Index 2025 and noticed something that often goes under the radar: the countries moving faster aren't the ones investing the most, but the ones connecting strategy, technology, and purpose in a clear way.

In Peru, many brands still treat AI as an experiment. But during end-of-year campaigns, that can be costly. The real difference between an effective campaign and one that goes unnoticed happens behind the scenes, in the data quality, the precision of the prompt, and the balance between creativity and automation.

Integrating AI isn't just about adding new tools. It's about changing how teams think, decide, and measure success.

**Title:** Three weeks ago, I was checking out the new versions...

...of Granite 4.0, Claude 4.5, and Sora 2, and it hit me that the evolution of AI is no longer just about who reasons better.

Now, the real shift is in how these models are starting to connect with each other.

I believe the next big leap will come when they begin to collaborate as a network, sharing context, learning together, and acting in sync.

**Title:** The future isn't just about using AI. It's about understanding it.

A month ago, I joined a session organized by the Ministry of Production, created for Peruvian entrepreneurs who are learning to adapt to an increasingly tech-driven world.

I shared how artificial intelligence is transforming the way we do business in Peru and how it can become a real ally for those building something of their own.

📌 Here's the article that JC Magazine published about the talk: https://lnkd.in/gdiFHjuA

I enjoy being part of these spaces because every conversation brings technology closer to people and helps us understand its real role in innovation and growth.

In the end, innovation isn't about replacing with AI. It's about learning to work with it. 🤝🏻

**Title:** Adaptation is not starting from zero, it's learning differently

Arriving at a new environment and admitting you don't know everything doesn't diminish your value. It gives you perspective.

I've learned that adaptation begins when you stop searching for certainties and start observing with attention. Every change has reminded me that nothing is guaranteed. That you always have to relearn: how you communicate, how you lead, and how you make decisions.

For years I worked with teams from different parts of the world, and that taught me something simple but powerful: there is no single right way to work. Adapting is listening more, reading the context, and adjusting how you collaborate.

For a long time I thought not having all the answers was a disadvantage. Today I know that admitting it is what accelerates learning. It makes you more receptive, more strategic, and more aware of what's happening around you.

When was the last time you let go of the map to learn from scratch again?

**Title:** AI is starting to act, not just respond.

OpenAI's announcement at DevDay 2025 marks a turning point. ChatGPT is no longer just an assistant; it has become a contextual executor, capable of connecting with apps such as Spotify, Canva, and Zapier, coordinating complete flows, and acting with judgement.

This leap transforms AI into a conversational operating system, capable of integrating tools, managing data and moving forward without relying on instructions. We are no longer talking about prompts, but about ecosystems that understand intent, context and rules.

The challenge now is not to choose the best model, but to design the bridges that connect tools, data, and decisions so that AI can advance with its own sense of purpose.

📌 In my slides, I share key insights to help you understand how this change is redefining the future of automation.

**Title:** Product and sales: do they speak the same language?

I have seen teams where product and sales seem to live in different worlds. Roadmaps, releases and features versus objections, customer conversations and closing times. It is not a lack of intention; the problem arises when there are no clear points of contact to keep both teams aligned.

What works: recurring spaces to share context, feedback, and priorities. That way, everyone has the same vision, even if they're looking at it from different angles.

When this happens, decisions flow faster and the product is built with a vision connected to the market. It also reduces duplication of effort and allows you to anticipate problems before they reach the customer.

In my slides, I share key insights for closing the gap between product and sales. ⬇️

**Title:** Artificial intelligence is no longer a future experiment...

In Peru, it has become a tool that's transforming how consumers search for information, make decisions, and relate to brands.

Users don't decide alone anymore: they do it alongside algorithms that filter, recommend, and prioritize what they see in seconds. And that completely changes the rules of marketing. 👨🏻‍💻

That's why the question is no longer whether we should use AI, but how we're leveraging it. Because it's not just about generating prompts or automating processes, it's about understanding how data and creativity can work together to create smarter, more relevant messages.

**Title:** The Best Stack Isn't the Newest One

In the past year, while working in Sales, I started learning how to build apps using AI. I'm still early in this journey, but one lesson has really stuck with me: choosing technology is less about chasing what is new and more about finding what truly fits the business.

The tech stack you pick shapes how fast you move, how well you integrate, and how sustainable your growth becomes.

From what I've observed, the strongest teams don't follow hype. They pick tools that match their business model, their team's capabilities, and their existing systems. The best stack isn't the most complex, it's the one that accelerates results without creating unnecessary friction.

This shift in perspective has changed how I look at tools, even in my sales work.

📌 In my graphic, I share a simple way to think about designing a tech stack that balances innovation with real business outcomes.

**Title:** Let's move from the pitch to the backlog 📊

The most valuable information in any business doesn't live in a dashboard. It lives in every single conversation with a customer.

Every day, sales teams detect patterns, objections, and real market signals.

But if that knowledge isn't captured or translated into actions, it fades away long with the chance to refine product, messaging, and strategy.

I've seen this many times:
👉🏻 Sales tries to explain why customers decide.
👉🏻 Product seeks insights directly from customers, but often without the full commercial context.

The result? Mixed messages. Duplicated efforts. And decisions made in the dark.

The answer isn't more reports it's a simple, structured feedback flow where every conversation becomes actionable: problem, impact, frequency.

When the voice of the customer moves from pitch to backlog, alignment becomes tangible.

Products evolve faster, sales cycles shorten, and strategies gain focus.

**Title:** What if your next entrepreneurial project were powered by AI?

Last week I had the privilege of leading the Practical AI for Entrepreneurs workshop at the Ministry of Production. Together with local entrepreneurs, we explored how AI can create measurable results by automating tasks, managing data, and optimizing workflows using tools as simple as WhatsApp or a landing MVP.

The golden rule I shared was simple: Goal → Tool → Metric.

With this framework, any entrepreneur can test, adjust, and measure the impact of AI in just seven days, without advanced technical knowledge.

We also worked on defining prompts, automating flows, and building consistency, so participants left with practical steps to apply right away.

I am grateful to the Ministry of Production for the invitation and the opportunity to share these lessons with entrepreneurs who are shaping the future of business in our region.

**Title:** Context first, prompts second.

I've heard people say context engineering is the new prompt engineering. For me, they're different, and they actually work best together in larger AI projects.

What I like about context engineering is that it turns AI into a real collaborator. You define its role, the data it needs, and how it connects with APIs or databases. That way, the model understands the full setup and doesn't need step-by-step hand-holding.

In my tests with agents, once the context is clear, AI stops being a "one-off trick" and becomes part of the system that scales and delivers every day.

**Title:** Is your digital roadmap a living plan or just a shopping list of tools? 🌐

Digital transformation isn't about adding more tech. It's about aligning every tool with a business result, sales, efficiency, or customer experience and sequencing them with purpose.

A roadmap that works isn't static: it adapts, evolves, and scales with your business. From my experience, it feels just like building a sales pipeline: you set the goal, map the steps, refine the pitch, and measure the impact.

The difference? Tech only matters when it becomes part of the daily workflow, not when it lives as a side project.

📌 In my slides I share a framework to design roadmaps that actually move the numbers, not just look good on paper.

**Title:** ChatGPT-5: Revolution or just steady progress?

GPT-5 was officially released by OpenAI on August 7, 2025, with access extended to both free and paid ChatGPT users on the same day.

Replacing GPT-4 created mistrust when it came back, it proved that trust and familiarity often beat novelty. And while context retention is a real strength, code quality still lags behind models like Claude Opus 4.1.

The strangest part? Accuracy feels inconsistent: today flawless, tomorrow a basic logic slip. That's what makes it harder to trust at scale.

From my view, GPT-5 is not a failure, but not a revolution either. The real value will come with customization, stability, and a voice that feels closer to human.

**Title:** Influence maps are no longer optional. They're the playbook for modern sales.

The customer journey isn't linear anymore. We move from streaming to scrolling, searching, and shopping in just minutes. In this reality, influence maps have become essential to uncover what truly drives a purchase decision.

More than a pretty chart, these maps need to be part of the sales routine:
✅ Prioritize efforts.
✅ Shorten cycles.
✅ Refine the pitch.

AI also enhances this approach, ensuring consistency from the very first social post to the product page, always highlighting the same benefits and strengths.

From my perspective, working with influence maps feels like entering a meeting with a pre-call plan on steroids: you know what to say, when, and how to start.

**Title:** From Failure to Framework: Lessons That Pay Off ✍🏼

Failure is not a full stop it's a turning point. Looking back at my career, I've realized that the most expensive mistakes often became the most profitable lessons. What truly matters is not avoiding failure, but creating a framework to turn each stumble into strategy.

In sales, every "no" becomes a sharper lens for the next approach. Each lost deal is not just a loss it's data. It tells you what didn't resonate, what questions you missed, and where you need to reframe your value. The key is not to see rejection as a dead end, but as intellectual capital that fuels your next move.

This reframe became clearer when I started treating objections as invitations to dig deeper. Each call should begin with a clear value hypothesis and a solid pre-call plan to anticipate pushback. That way, losing a client doesn't push you backward it arms you with the data to return with more precision.

Failure, when reframed, stops being a burden and becomes the foundation of growth. It's not the end of the story; it's the insight that rewrites the next chapter.

What's been your most valuable "failure" lesson? I'm curious how others have turned setbacks into strategy.

**Title:** 95% of GenAI pilots fail. It is not the AI, it is the friction.

MIT's State of AI in Business 2025 found that most pilots remain flashy demos that never scale. As this chart shows, Forbes identified the same 3 blockers: human, organizational, and technical friction.

I saw this myself when testing AI tools for sales automation. It was not the models that failed, it was the messy data, unclear success metrics, and weak integrations. The shiny outputs looked great, but they did not move numbers.

The companies that succeed design for friction from day one:
→ Build trust, so teams actually use the tools.
→ Align incentives and governance with the pilot's goals.
→ Fix data pipelines and integrations before showing off screenshots.

The lesson is simple: flashy demos do not create business value. Systems that learn, adapt, and connect to real workflows do.

📌 Is your AI pilot built to scale, or just to impress in the demo?
