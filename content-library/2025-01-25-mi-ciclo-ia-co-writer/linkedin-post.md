# Mi Ciclo de IA - Claude as Co-Writer

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Theme:** What I Built
**Audience:** Segment A (Career Pivot)
**Content Type:** LinkedIn Post
**Status:** Draft inputs ready

---

## Topic Overview

Building an AI co-writer system that goes beyond prompting—using context engineering, SOPs, and structured knowledge to create a "second brain" for content creation.

**Core thesis:** Most people prompt AI. The real leverage is building a system that knows your voice, your audience, and your constraints before you even start.

---

## Hook Options (Pick 1)

### Option A: Contrarian Take (Recommended)
```
Everyone's talking about prompts.

I stopped prompting 3 months ago. Now I build context.
```

### Option B: What I Built
```
Built a co-writer system that knows my voice better than I do.

Here's the setup that replaced 4 hours of content creation with 45 minutes.
```

### Option C: Reframe
```
The problem with AI writing isn't the AI.

It's that you're starting from scratch every time.
```

### Option D: Before/After
```
Before: 4 hours to write one LinkedIn post (research, drafts, edits).

After: 45 minutes—same quality, consistent voice.

Here's what changed.
```

---

## Problem (Setup)

**Pain point to highlight:**

Most people use AI like a magic 8-ball: ask a question, get an answer, start over.

Every session starts from zero:
- Re-explain your audience
- Re-describe your voice
- Re-state what you're trying to achieve
- Hope the AI "gets it" this time

Result: Inconsistent outputs, generic content, hours spent editing AI garbage into something usable.

**Relatable framing:**
```
I was spending more time editing AI output than writing from scratch.

The posts didn't sound like me. The audience framing was off.
And every new session, I had to re-explain everything.
```

## Build (What You Created)

**Technical approach (accessible detail):**

Built a "context-first" co-writer system:

1. **Context file** - Pre-loaded with:
   - Voice DNA (signature phrases, sentence rhythm, words I use/avoid)
   - Audience definitions (two segments with specific pain points)
   - Content pillars (what I write about and why)
   - Employment safety rules (what I can/can't say publicly)

2. **SOP library** - Structured guides for:
   - LinkedIn post structure (hook → setup → build → payoff → question)
   - Hook formulas (9 patterns with usage frequency)
   - Theme-specific rules (builds, boring business, thought leadership)

3. **Knowledge base** - Reference materials:
   - Past posts that performed well
   - Audience research
   - Proof points and metrics I can cite

**Tools used:**
- Claude (API or Claude Code)
- Markdown files (simple, portable)
- Git repo (version control, iteration tracking)

**What it looks like:**
```
Instead of: "Write me a LinkedIn post about AI"

I say: "Write about [topic]"

The system already knows:
→ Who I'm writing for
→ How I sound
→ What structure to use
→ What I can't say (employment safety)
```

---

## Results (Quantified)

**Time savings:**
- Content creation: 4 hours → 45 minutes per post
- Editing time: 90% reduction (outputs match my voice)
- Research time: Built into context, not repeated

**Quality improvements:**
- Consistent voice across posts
- Right audience framing every time
- No more "sounds like AI" output
- Employment-safe by default

**Meta benefit:**
- The act of building the system clarified my content strategy
- Forced me to articulate who I'm writing for and why
- Created a reusable asset (not just prompts)

---

## Lesson (Transferable Insight)

**Primary lesson:**
```
Context engineering > prompt engineering.

A good prompt with no context = generic output.
An average prompt with rich context = tailored output.

The leverage is in the setup, not the ask.
```

**Secondary lessons:**
- Building the system is the strategy work (forces clarity)
- Constraints make AI better (employment safety rules improved output)
- Simple beats complex (markdown files > fancy tools)

---

## Engagement Questions (Pick 1)

### For Career audience:
- "What system do you use for consistent content creation?"
- "Anyone else building their own AI workflows instead of using off-the-shelf tools?"
- "What's one thing you'd pre-load into an AI co-writer?"

### Broader appeal:
- "Do you prompt from scratch every time, or have you built something reusable?"

## Visual Asset Ideas

1. **Before/After diagram**
   - Left: "Prompting" (start from zero, re-explain everything)
   - Right: "Context system" (pre-loaded knowledge, just add topic)

2. **System architecture** (simple)
   - Context file → SOP library → Knowledge base → Output

3. **Screenshot** of folder structure or context file snippet

4. **Time comparison chart**
   - Before: 4 hours (research, draft, edit, edit, edit)
   - After: 45 minutes (topic → draft → light edit → done)

## Full Draft Option

```
Everyone's talking about prompts.

I stopped prompting 3 months ago. Now I build context.

---

Here's what I mean:

Most people use AI like a magic 8-ball. Ask a question, get an
answer, start over next time.

Every session begins from zero:
→ Re-explain your audience
→ Re-describe your voice
→ Re-state your goals
→ Hope the AI "gets it"

I was spending more time editing AI output than writing from scratch.

---

So I built something different.

A co-writer system with pre-loaded context:

1. Voice DNA - My signature phrases, sentence rhythm, words I use
   and avoid

2. Audience definitions - Two segments with specific pain points
   and language that resonates

3. Content SOPs - Hook formulas, post structures, theme-specific
   rules

4. Safety constraints - What I can/can't say publicly (employment
   considerations)

Now when I write, I don't start from zero.

The system already knows who I'm writing for, how I sound, and
what I'm trying to achieve.

---

Results after 3 months:

• Content time: 4 hours → 45 minutes per post
• Editing: Down 90% (outputs match my voice)
• Consistency: Same quality, same voice, every time

---

The meta benefit?

Building the system was the strategy work.

It forced me to articulate:
→ Who am I actually writing for?
→ What makes my voice different?
→ What are my constraints?

The AI co-writer is useful. But the clarity from building it was
the real win.

---

Key insight: Context engineering > prompt engineering.

A good prompt with no context = generic output.
An average prompt with rich context = tailored output.

The leverage is in the setup, not the ask.

Do you prompt from scratch every time, or have you built something
reusable?

- This post works well as a carousel (visual system explanation)
- Could expand into Substack deep-dive with more technical detail
- Safe for employment: frames as personal experiment/learning
