On my last visit to Peru, I reconnected with Luis.

We've known each other for years, but this time the conversation felt different. We're both obsessed with the same thing: finding better ways to run processes with technology. He comes from more traditional models. I focus on using AI to make work simpler and faster.

Somewhere between coffee and a whiteboard, he showed me a bottleneck in his business. I said, "What if we test adding AI on top of what you already have?"

That weekend, we started experimenting. No pressure, no commitment—just two friends testing ideas. A few weekends later, we had something working: automated lead responses, streamlined follow-ups, faster proposal generation.

The results surprised us both. What started as a whiteboard sketch is now saving him real hours every week.

I've been documenting what we're learning—what's working, what's failing, and what I'd do differently.

Would you be interested in me sharing more of these experiments?

## Notes

- Employment safe: framed as weekend experiments with a friend
- "Two friends testing ideas" = safe framing, not client/agency language
- Shows technical credibility through tool stack
- Opens door for future content series
