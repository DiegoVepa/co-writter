## Final Post

Most AI pilots fail.

Not because the technology doesn't work—it usually does.

They fail because nobody figured out how to connect the shiny new tool to the boring daily workflow.

---

I've watched 6 AI pilots launch this year.

2 made it to production. 4 are "on pause."

Here's what separated the winners:

---

1. Integration is 80% of the work

Most teams spend:
→ 80% of effort on selecting/testing the AI
→ 20% on integration and adoption

The winners flipped this.

They treated the AI as the easy part. Making it stick was the job.

---

2. They started with workflow, not technology

Wrong: "We have AI. What should we do with it?"
Right: "We have a bottleneck. Could AI help?"

Technology-first = orphan tool looking for a home.
Workflow-first = solution that fits existing behavior.

---

3. The AI was invisible to users

The best implementations don't say "use this new AI tool."

They say "your existing process just got faster."

→ AI that pre-fills forms users already complete
→ AI that drafts emails in tools they already use
→ AI that surfaces insights in dashboards they already check

Adoption isn't a training problem. It's a design problem.

---

4. They measured business outcomes, not AI metrics

Vanity metrics: "We processed 10,000 documents with AI."

Business metrics: "Quote turnaround dropped from 2 days to 2 hours."

If you can't connect the AI to a business number, you don't have value yet.

---

The bottom line:

Integration beats innovation.

The company with 70% AI accuracy that's integrated everywhere will outperform the company with 95% accuracy stuck in a pilot.

Ship something that connects. Improve it later.

What's killed more AI pilots at your company: the technology or the integration?
