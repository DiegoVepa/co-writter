## Final Post Content

For my PhD research on AI adoption, I've been testing video production tools with small businesses.

**The pattern I keep seeing:** The technology gap has closed. The awareness gap is massive.

I ran a test: could a local service business create corporate-quality video without a production team?

**The stack:**
- Script: Claude (10 minutes)
- Voiceover: ElevenLabs (professional quality, free tier)
- Visuals: Runway + stock footage
- Editing: Descript

**Cost:** $0 on free tiers (or ~$50/month for premium)
**Previous cost:** $8K-$12K with agency

**The output?** You couldn't tell it wasn't professionally produced.

But here's what my research is uncovering: **most SMB owners don't know these tools exist.** And when they do, they don't know where to start.

The adoption barrier isn't cost anymore. It's the bridge from "this exists" to "I know how to use this."

**For those running small businesses: if you're not using video because of cost, that barrier just disappeared. The tools are ready.**

## Strategic Notes

**Audience Fit:**
- **Career Track:** Shows builder mindset, testing approach, technical stack knowledge
- **Agency Track:** Demonstrates understanding of SMB constraints + proves capability with specific solution

**Employment Safety:** ✅
- Framed as PhD research (legitimate context)
- "Testing with small businesses" (not "client work")
- Shows capability without offering services

**Voice DNA:** ✅
- "What I built" structure
- Specific tools + costs (credibility through detail)
- Insight sharing (not asking for data)
- Practitioner demonstrating, not guru preaching

**Engagement Goal:**
- Position as someone who bridges theory (PhD research) and practice (actual testing)
- Signal to SMBs: "This person understands your constraints and has solutions"
- Signal to hiring managers: "This person researches AND builds"

**Key Insight:**
"The adoption barrier isn't cost anymore. It's the bridge from 'this exists' to 'I know how to use this.'" - This positions you perfectly for future agency work helping SMBs cross that bridge.
