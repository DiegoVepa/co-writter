## 1. The Problem: Missed Calls & Revenue Loss

### Key Statistics

| Stat | Source |
|------|--------|
| **$45K-$120K/year** lost to unanswered calls (avg contractor) | [CallBird AI](https://www.callbirdai.com/blog-contractors-lose-money-missed-calls) |
| **$180** average revenue lost per missed HVAC call | [Adaptify](https://www.adaptify.tech/article/cost-of-missed-calls-hvac) |
| **$900+** average emergency service call value | Industry data |
| **30%** of calls go to voicemail | [Voctiv](https://voctiv.com/top-hvac-contractor-answering-service-solutions-for-2025/) |
| **60%** of voicemail callers don't leave messages | Industry data |
| **85%** of missed callers won't call back | [Dialora AI](https://www.dialora.ai/blog/missed-call-costs-smbs-revenue-loss-ai-solutions) |

### Real Quote
> "I was literally sleeping through $80,000/month in emergency revenue. People's AC breaks at 9 PM in 105-degree weather—they're not waiting until morning."
> — HVAC company owner, Dallas

### Visual Opportunity
**Slide idea:** "The Math of Missed Calls"
- 50 missed calls/month × $180 avg value = **$9,000/month lost**
- Annual impact: **$108,000**

## 2. No-Shows: The Hidden Revenue Killer

### Key Statistics

| Stat | Source |
|------|--------|
| **$300-600** lost per no-show (truck roll cost) | [Workiz](https://www.workiz.com/blog/hvac/hvac-service-scheduling-best-practices/) |
| **10-50 no-shows/month** typical for HVAC business | Industry average |
| **50-60%** reduction in no-shows with reminder systems | [DropCowboy](https://www.dropcowboy.com/resources/appointment-reminders-complete-guide) |
| **126%** improvement in confirmation rates with weekly reminders | [SCIMUS](https://thescimus.com/blog/reminder-systems-no-show-reduction/) |

### Reminder Sequence That Works
1. **72 hours before** — Email confirmation
2. **24 hours before** — Text reminder
3. **2 hours before** — "Confirm or reschedule" text
4. **30 min before** — "Technician en route" SMS

**Result:** 50-70% reduction in no-shows

### Visual Opportunity
**Slide idea:** "Before/After No-Shows"
- Before: 30% no-show rate → 15 wasted trips/month → **$6,000 lost**
- After: 12% no-show rate → 6 wasted trips/month → **$2,400 lost**
- **Savings: $3,600/month**

| **68%** of field service managers cite "inefficient scheduling" as top challenge | Aberdeen Group |

### The Paperwork Problem
- 10 field techs × 1 hour/day on paperwork × $75/hour = **$750/day wasted**
- Monthly: **$16,500**
- Annual: **$198,000** on paperwork alone

### Visual Opportunity
**Slide idea:** "Where 10 Hours Go"
