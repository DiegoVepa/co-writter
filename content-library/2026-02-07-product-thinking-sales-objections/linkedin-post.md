Sales objections aren't blockers. They're unstructured product feedback.

For years, I was trained to overcome objections. Handle them. Reframe them. Push past them.

Then I started paying attention to what customers were actually saying.

"Your pricing doesn't make sense for our size."
"We already have something that does part of this."
"I'd need to get three other people involved."

These aren't roadblocks. They're data points.

The shift: I stopped treating objections as problems to solve in the moment. I started logging them as patterns to solve in the product.

Here's the framework I use now:

-> **Capture:** What did they actually say? (exact words, not my interpretation)
-> **Pattern:** Have I heard this before? How often?
-> **Signal:** Is this a pricing issue, a positioning issue, or a feature gap?
-> **Route:** Does product know? Does marketing know?

After tagging objections for a few months, patterns emerged that changed how we talked about the product—and in some cases, what we built.

The insight: Product thinking applied to sales means treating every conversation as strategic input for the roadmap and value proposition—not just as a closing attempt.

**The best salespeople aren't just closers. They're the closest thing product teams have to real-time user research.**

How does your sales team feed insights back to product?

## Visual Asset Ideas

1. **4-box framework diagram:** Capture -> Pattern -> Signal -> Route
2. **Before/After mindset comparison:**
   - Before: "Handle the objection"
   - After: "Tag it, track it, feed it to product"
3. **Simple flowchart:** Objection -> Pattern Recognition -> Product Input -> Feature/Messaging Change
