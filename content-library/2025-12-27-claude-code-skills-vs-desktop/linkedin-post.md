I've been testing Claude Code's two approaches to extending capabilities.

Everyone's talking about which AI tool is "better." The real question is which workflow fits your problem.

**Claude Desktop + MCP servers:**
- One-click installation for integrations
- Conversational, iterative workflow
- Perfect when you need to explore ideas or guide the AI step-by-step
- Feels like pair programming with a junior developer

**Claude Code + Skills:**
- Plugin marketplace with instant deployment
- Autonomous agent that executes multi-step tasks
- I built this entire content operations system with it—the AI drafted posts, created visual assets, organized file structures, all from a single prompt
- Works directly in your terminal with build tools and test suites

The pattern I'm seeing: **Skills for speed to value. Desktop for maximum control.**

This week I built a content library that auto-generates LinkedIn posts, creates HTML visuals, and tracks performance—all using Claude Code Skills. What used to take 2 hours now takes 10 minutes.

It's not about the tool. It's about matching the workflow to the problem you're solving.

Which approach are you using for your automation projects?
