# Infographic Prompt

```
You are a visual infographic designer.
Generate a single hand-drawn infographic image.

TOPIC:
Claude Extensions: 3 Workflows

CONTENT TO VISUALIZE:
Section 1 - EXCEL (orange heading):
   • Daily habit tracker
   • Interactive dashboard
   • See patterns over time
[spreadsheet doodle]

Section 2 - POWERPOINT (orange heading):
   • DBA program slides
   • Consistent colors across decks
   • No manual formatting
[slides doodle]

Section 3 - CHROME (orange heading):
   • Debugging Vapi AI issue
   • Stuck for an hour → clarity
   • Walked through the fix
[browser doodle]

KEY TAKEAWAY:
Less friction. More thinking.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Generate ONE single image only.

STYLE:
- The image must look like a real photograph of a hand-drawn infographic
  on a whiteboard or premium off-white notebook page.
- Use ONLY these marker colors:
  - Black marker: all main text, structure lines, primary doodles
  - Orange marker (#E8611A): highlighted keywords, underlines, emphasis
    circles, section headers, key callouts
  - Dark charcoal (#2D2D2D): supporting/secondary text
  - Orange highlighter at ~40% opacity: keyword highlighting
- Do NOT use blue, red, green, or any other colors.
- Lines must be slightly imperfect and wobbly like real handwriting.
- All text must be handwritten (NO digital fonts anywhere in the image).
- Include small hand-drawn doodles/icons (arrows, light bulbs, checkmarks,
  stars, boxes, gears) in black with orange accents.
- Keep the design clean, structured, and highly readable.

LAYOUT:
- Dimensions: 1080 x 1350 pixels (portrait format).
- Title at the top: "CLAUDE EXTENSIONS" in big bold marker with orange underline.
- Subtitle: "3 Workflows" in smaller text
- 3 clear sections with hand-drawn separators/arrows between them.
- Each section should have:
   • a mini-heading in ORANGE marker (EXCEL, POWERPOINT, CHROME)
   • 2–3 bullet points (black marker)
   • one simple hand-drawn icon/doodle representing the tool
- Use hand-drawn boxes, arrows, separators, and highlights to guide the eye.
- Include the key takeaway boxed or circled near the bottom in orange.

VISUAL CLARITY RULES:
- Make text large and legible (this will be viewed on mobile phones).
- Do not overcrowd the page — generous whitespace between sections.
- Highlight only the most important words (2-3 per section maximum).

BOTTOM CTA:
Add handwritten text at the bottom:
"Follow @DiegoVences for more AI content"

IMAGE FORMAT:
- 1080 x 1350 pixels, portrait orientation.
- Bright natural lighting with slight realistic shadows.
- Background should be whiteboard or premium paper texture.
- The final image should look like a real photograph taken of a
  physical whiteboard/notebook — not a digital design.
