## Topic Overview

95% of AI pilots fail to reach production. Not because the AI doesn't work—but because nobody solved the integration, adoption, and workflow problems. This post addresses how companies actually scale from "cool demo" to real business impact.

**Core thesis:** The gap between AI pilot and production value isn't technical. It's operational. The companies that win aren't better at AI—they're better at integration.

## Hook Options (Pick 1)

### Option A: Contrarian Take (Recommended)
```
Most AI pilots fail.

Not because the technology doesn't work—it usually does.

They fail because nobody figured out how to connect the shiny
new tool to the boring daily workflow.
```

### Option B: Stat-Driven
```
95% of AI pilots never reach production.

The problem isn't the AI. It's what happens after the demo.
```

### Option C: Reframe
```
Everyone's celebrating their AI pilot.

Nobody's talking about why it died 3 months later.
```

### Option D: What I've Seen
```
I've watched 6 AI pilots launch this year.

2 made it to production. 4 are "on pause."

Here's what separated the winners.
```

## Problem (Setup)

**The pilot trap:**

Companies love pilots:
- Low commitment
- Exciting demos
- Leadership gets to say "we're doing AI"
- Easy to get budget approved

But pilots are designed to succeed in isolation.

The real test: Can it survive contact with actual workflows, actual users, actual edge cases?

**Why pilots fail:**

```
1. Demo ≠ Production
   Pilot: Works on clean data, controlled conditions
   Reality: Messy data, edge cases, integrations

2. Excitement ≠ Adoption
   Pilot: Champions use it because it's new
   Reality: Average employee has 47 other tools

3. IT project ≠ Business outcome
   Pilot: "We implemented AI!"
   Reality: "...and it saved us $0 because nobody uses it"
```

**Relatable framing:**
```
You've seen this movie:

Month 1: "This AI tool is amazing!"
Month 3: "We're still working on integration..."
Month 6: "The pilot is on pause while we evaluate..."
Month 12: Nobody mentions it again.

The AI worked. The implementation didn't.
```

## Build (Core Arguments)

### Argument 1: Integration is the real work (80%)

```
Most teams spend:
• 80% of effort on selecting/testing the AI
• 20% on integration and adoption

Winners flip this:
• 20% on the AI (it mostly works)
• 80% on connecting it to existing workflows

The AI is the easy part. Making it stick is the job.
```

### Argument 2: Start with the workflow, not the technology

```
Wrong approach:
"We have AI. What should we do with it?"

Right approach:
"We have a bottleneck. Could AI help?"

The difference:
→ Technology-first = orphan tool looking for a home
→ Workflow-first = solution that fits existing behavior
```

### Argument 3: The "invisible integration" principle

```
The best AI implementations are invisible to users.

They don't say: "Now use this new AI tool"
They say: "Your existing process just got faster"

Examples:
→ AI that pre-fills forms users already complete
→ AI that drafts emails in the tool they already use
→ AI that surfaces insights in dashboards they already check

Adoption isn't a training problem. It's a design problem.
```

### Argument 4: Measure business outcomes, not AI metrics

```
Vanity metrics:
• "We processed 10,000 documents with AI"
• "Our model has 94% accuracy"
• "Users made 500 AI queries"

Business metrics:
• "Quote turnaround dropped from 2 days to 2 hours"
• "Customer response time improved 40%"
• "We reassigned 2 FTEs from data entry to analysis"

If you can't connect the AI to a business number, you don't have value yet.
```

## Framework: Pilot to Production Checklist

**Before the pilot:**
- [ ] Is there a real workflow pain point? (not just "AI would be cool")
- [ ] Who owns the outcome? (not just the technology)
- [ ] What's the success metric? (business outcome, not AI metric)

**During the pilot:**
- [ ] Are real users (not champions) testing it?
- [ ] Is it connected to actual systems (not test data)?
- [ ] Are we documenting edge cases and failures?

**Before scaling:**
- [ ] Can average employees use it without training?
- [ ] Does it integrate with existing tools (not require new ones)?
- [ ] Is there clear ROI that leadership will fund ongoing?

---

## Results / Evidence

**Pattern from successful implementations:**

What the 2 successful pilots I saw had in common:
1. Started with a specific bottleneck (not "AI strategy")
2. Integrated into existing workflow (no new tools to learn)
3. Had a business owner, not just IT sponsor
4. Measured dollars/hours saved, not "AI adoption"

**What the 4 failed pilots had in common:**
1. Started with "we should use AI"
2. Required users to change behavior
3. Owned by IT or innovation team (no P&L accountability)
4. Measured activity, not outcomes

---

## Lesson (Transferable Insight)

**Primary lesson:**
```
Integration beats innovation.

The company with 70% AI accuracy that's integrated everywhere
will outperform the company with 95% accuracy that's stuck in a pilot.

Ship something that connects. Improve it later.
```

**Secondary lessons:**
```
• The AI vendor's job ends at "it works."
  Your job starts at "it's adopted."

• If users need training, the integration is wrong.

• Pilots are permission to learn.
  Production is permission to invest.
  Don't confuse the two.
```

## Engagement Questions (Pick 1)

### For Career audience:
- "What's killed more AI pilots at your company: the technology or the integration?"
- "Have you seen an AI pilot actually make it to production? What was different?"
- "What's the biggest gap between AI demo and production reality you've experienced?"

### Broader:
- "Why do you think most AI pilots fail?"

## Full Draft Option

```
Most AI pilots fail.

Not because the technology doesn't work—it usually does.

They fail because nobody figured out how to connect the shiny
new tool to the boring daily workflow.

I've watched 6 AI pilots launch this year.

2 made it to production. 4 are "on pause."

Here's what separated the winners:

---

1. Integration is 80% of the work

Most teams spend:
→ 80% of effort on selecting/testing the AI
→ 20% on integration and adoption

The winners flipped this.

They treated the AI as the easy part. Making it stick was the job.

---

2. They started with workflow, not technology

Wrong: "We have AI. What should we do with it?"
Right: "We have a bottleneck. Could AI help?"

Technology-first = orphan tool looking for a home.
Workflow-first = solution that fits existing behavior.

---

3. The AI was invisible to users

The best implementations don't say "use this new AI tool."

They say "your existing process just got faster."

→ AI that pre-fills forms users already complete
→ AI that drafts emails in tools they already use
→ AI that surfaces insights in dashboards they already check

Adoption isn't a training problem. It's a design problem.

---

4. They measured business outcomes, not AI metrics

Vanity metrics: "We processed 10,000 documents with AI."

Business metrics: "Quote turnaround dropped from 2 days to 2 hours."

If you can't connect the AI to a business number, you don't have
value yet.

The bottom line:

Integration beats innovation.

The company with 70% AI accuracy that's integrated everywhere
will outperform the company with 95% accuracy stuck in a pilot.

Ship something that connects. Improve it later.
