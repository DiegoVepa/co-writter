## Final Post

The most interesting AI companies in 2026 won't be in Silicon Valley.

They'll be plumbing companies in Phoenix and HVAC shops in Dallas.

---

Here's why:

Everyone's talking about AI transforming enterprises.

The real disruption? A 25-year-old starting a service business with AI-native operations from day one.

No legacy systems. No "but we've always done it this way."

Just: what's the best way to run this with today's tools?

---

What "AI-native" actually means:

It's not fancy chatbots. It's operational advantage.

→ Leads get instant response (not "we'll call you back")
→ Quotes go out same-day (not 48-hour wait)
→ Appointments confirm automatically (no-shows drop 60%)
→ Invoices follow up themselves (zero admin time)

The customer doesn't see the AI. They just see:
Faster. Better. More reliable.

---

The economics favor starting fresh:

Cost to transform an established business:
• Software migrations
• Training reluctant staff
• Months of disruption

Cost to build AI-native from scratch:
• $50/month in tools
• 20 hours of setup
• Compound advantage from day one

---

This creates a new competitive moat.

In 5 years, the landscaping company that:
→ Responds to leads in 30 seconds
→ Sends quotes before the customer hangs up
→ Never forgets a follow-up
→ Automatically collects reviews

...will dominate the one still using paper and voicemail.

Not because they're better at landscaping.
Because they're better at operations.

---

The opportunity isn't building AI for tech companies.

It's rebuilding how traditional businesses operate.

And the best time to go AI-native? Before you have anything to transform.

---

What "boring" industry do you think has the biggest AI opportunity that nobody's talking about?
