## Final Post

Most people think AI fails because of the model.

After 20+ projects, I can tell you: it's almost never the model.

---

The "AI lifecycle" they teach has 12 neat steps:
→ Define problem
→ Collect data
→ Train model
→ Deploy
→ Monitor

Sounds orderly. Professional.

But in reality, here's how it actually goes:

Steps 1-6: 20% of the effort
Steps 7-12: 80% of the pain

---

Where AI projects actually die:

1. "Ready" data that wasn't ready
   (90% of time is cleaning what they promised was already clean)

2. Deployment without an owner
   (IT installs it, business doesn't use it, nobody measures it)

3. Models degrading silently
   (Worked great 3 months ago. Nobody's checked since)

4. "The algorithm is wrong"
   (No. The process feeding it is wrong)

---

What I learned:

The AI cycle isn't linear. It's a loop.

And 80% of the loop isn't building—it's operating.

Training a model: weeks.
Operating it well: months. Years.

---

The question nobody asks at the start:
"Who's going to monitor this when it's no longer new?"

If you don't have an answer, the model already has an expiration date.

Which of these mistakes have you seen most in production?
