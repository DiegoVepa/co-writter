Learning Meta Ads isn't hard.
Making sense of the data is.

When I started studying paid media more seriously, I noticed something frustrating: there's a lot of information, but very little clarity. Dashboards, reports, docs, notes... everything lives in a different place.

So I ran a small experiment with @NotebookLM. I didn't use it to "optimize campaigns," but as a study tool. I uploaded reports, added my notes, and started asking questions.

What surprised me was how quickly I could connect metrics to actual behavior and spot patterns. No complicated prompts. No fancy setup. Just a cleaner way to think through messy information.

AI is most useful right now: not replacing expertise, but helping me build it faster.
